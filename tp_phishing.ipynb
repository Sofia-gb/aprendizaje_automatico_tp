Assuming a\\n2km-wide --- that is, 20 000 decimeter-wide --- spherical asteroid of\\nspecific gravity 10, 4/3 pi r^3 says it would have a volume of 4e12\\ncubic decimeters and thus a mass of 4e13 kg.  The force we'd have to\\napply to achieve this acceleration would be roughly equivalent to the\\nweight of 200 kg here on Earth.So, yeah, ion drives are probably a no-go, unless I screwed up the\\ncalculations here; I think the force they typically exert is about\\nfour orders of magnitude too small.If we just wanted to hit today it with enough of an impulse that it\\nwould miss us 17 years later, we'd need to accelerate it by about 1.1\\ncm/s.  A one-ton (1000kg) mass would need to hit it at about 4e9 m/s,\\nor about ten times the speed of light, to achieve this, so that's not\\npossible.  (If you could actually put enough work into a one-ton mass,\\nas it approached the speed of light, it would mass more, so you could\\nstill do it with a one-ton mass; but we don't have anything\\napproaching that speed.)  The impulse required is inversely\\nproportional to the remaining time to impact, so if we were to hit it\\nafter half the time has elapsed, we'd need to accelerate it by around\\n2.2 cm/s instead.The gravitational force of an Earth-sized mass could provide\\nsufficient deflection if that mass were about 4.5e5 times as far away\\nfrom the asteroid as we are from Earth's center, or about 2.7e9 m, or\\nabout 0.018 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun (0.018 AU).\\n(And if that mass stayed so nearby for 17 years.)The effects of continuous acceleration benefit greatly from planning\\nahead, since they scale with t^2, not t --- and thus the needed\\nacceleration scales with 1/t^2.  After half the time has elapsed, we'd\\nneed four times as much acceleration to make it miss the Earth than if\\nwe were to start accelerating it now.All of these numbers are a little low, because the Earth presents a\\nslightly easier target than its physical size suggests, due to its\\ngravity well.  How much easier depends on the speed of the projectile\\nin ways I don't understand.They're also a little high, because they assume the force is being\\napplied purely at right angles to the asteroid's current path, which\\nis a slightly suboptimal scenario (although for velocity changes five\\norders of magnitude smaller than the relative velocity, the difference\\nis probably insignificant.)  And they assume there are no other effects on the asteroid's path.What about electrical charges?  Could we electrically charge the\\nasteroid and another nearby asteroid, perhaps with electron beams, to\\nprovide the needed acceleration?Of course, all of this calculation could be applied in the other\\ndirection, too.  If you want to sock a moon colony with a one-ton\\nasteroid, you could do it with a tiny amount of force applied over\\ntwenty-five years to adjust its orbit.***About spam: I'm sorry to admit I haven't implemented any of the better\\nsolutions, and so I'm afraid I'll have to allow non-subscriber FoRK\\nmail to be detained for scanning.  I hope this measure can be reversed\\nsoon when I have time to implement better measures.  As has often been\\nnoted by other posters, measures to reduce spam sent to the FoRK list\\nwill not significantly decrease the spam load of FoRKposters, since\\nthe vast majority of spam received by FoRKposters is sent to them\\ndirectly, not through the FoRK list.-- \\n       Kragen Sitaker     \\nSilence may not be golden, but at least it's quiet.  Don't speak unless you\\ncan improve the silence.  I have often regretted my speech, never my silence.\\n-- ancient philosopher Syrus (?) via Adam Rifkin, \\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\\n</td>\n",

       "11250  Eugen Leitl writes:\\n> Apart from twiddling with the surface albedo which might be not\\n> enough -- we currently don't have ion drives with enough power, or at\\n> least we can't develop and deploy them on time, My estimate is that, in the worst case, we have 17 years (5.4e8\\nseconds) to move it one earth radius, or about 6000 km (6e6 m).  \\na t^2/2 = x, if I remember right, so a = 2x/t^2, which is \\n1.2e7 m/(2.9e17 s^2), or about 4.1e-11 m/s^2, which is not a very\\nlarge acceleration, roughly equivalent to the gravitational\\nacceleration in these parts divided by 200000000000.  Assuming a\\n2km-wide --- that is, 20 000 decimeter-wide --- spherical asteroid of\\nspecific gravity 10, 4/3 pi r^3 says it would have a volume of 4e12\\ncubic decimeters and thus a mass of 4e13 kg.  The force we'd have to\\napply to achieve this acceleration would be roughly equivalent to the\\nweight of 200 kg here on Earth.So, yeah, ion drives are probably a no-go, unless I screwed up the\\ncalculations here; I think the force they typically exert is about\\nfour orders of magnitude too small.If we just wanted to hit today it with enough of an impulse that it\\nwould miss us 17 years later, we'd need to accelerate it by about 1.1\\ncm/s.  A one-ton (1000kg) mass would need to hit it at about 4e9 m/s,\\nor about ten times the speed of light, to achieve this, so that's not\\npossible.  (If you could actually put enough work into a one-ton mass,\\nas it approached the speed of light, it would mass more, so you could\\nstill do it with a one-ton mass; but we don't have anything\\napproaching that speed.)  The impulse required is inversely\\nproportional to the remaining time to impact, so if we were to hit it\\nafter half the time has elapsed, we'd need to accelerate it by around\\n2.2 cm/s instead.The gravitational force of an Earth-sized mass could provide\\nsufficient deflection if that mass were about 4.5e5 times as far away\\nfrom the asteroid as we are from Earth's center, or about 2.7e9 m, or\\nabout 0.018 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun (0.018 AU).\\n(And if that mass stayed so nearby for 17 years.)The effects of continuous acceleration benefit greatly from planning\\nahead, since they scale with t^2, not t --- and thus the needed\\nacceleration scales with 1/t^2.  After half the time has elapsed, we'd\\nneed four times as much acceleration to make it miss the Earth than if\\nwe were to start accelerating it now.All of these numbers are a little low, because the Earth presents a\\nslightly easier target than its physical size suggests, due to its\\ngravity well.  How much easier depends on the speed of the projectile\\nin ways I don't understand.They're also a little high, because they assume the force is being\\napplied purely at right angles to the asteroid's current path, which\\nis a slightly suboptimal scenario (although for velocity changes five\\norders of magnitude smaller than the relative velocity, the difference\\nis probably insignificant.)  And they assume there are no other effects on the asteroid's path.What about electrical charges?  Could we electrically charge the\\nasteroid and another nearby asteroid, perhaps with electron beams, to\\nprovide the needed acceleration?Of course, all of this calculation could be applied in the other\\ndirection, too.  If you want to sock a moon colony with a one-ton\\nasteroid, you could do it with a tiny amount of force applied over\\ntwenty-five years to adjust its orbit.***About spam: I'm sorry to admit I haven't implemented any of the better\\nsolutions, and so I'm afraid I'll have to allow non-subscriber FoRK\\nmail to be detained for scanning.  I hope this measure can be reversed\\nsoon when I have time to implement better measures.  As has often been\\nnoted by other posters, measures to reduce spam sent to the FoRK list\\nwill not significantly decrease the spam load of FoRKposters, since\\nthe vast majority of spam received by FoRKposters is sent to them\\ndirectly, not through the FoRK list.-- \\n       Kragen Sitaker     \\nSilence may not be golden, but at least it's quiet.  Don't speak unless you\\ncan improve the silence.

After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some \\ncarriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, \\nthe future may be dim. But for those survivors of the industry \\nthat have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems \\nmean opportunity. \"Every major industry in the history of \\nthe United States has experienced a similar transformation, from \\nthe railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the mid-1900s \\nto the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,\" says Robert \\nSaunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market \\nresearch firm. Christopher \\nDean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says \"We are seeing all \\nthe people that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money \\nand for the surviving carriers out there, they can get what used \\nto cost a few billion for a few millions.\" Read the full \\nstory from Telecommunications Magazine - See the link at the end \\nof this newsletter. \\nAs we write this report, our New Recommendation \\nInDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: \\nIGTT) has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since \\nlate May of 2002. As InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its \\nbusiness plan, we believe this company will help lead the way \\nup for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector. This could be our \\nstrongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our Highest \\nRating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.\\nÂ \\nGround Floor Opportunity / Tremendous \\nGrowth Potential \\nWe believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not \\ngreater than its competition. A similar telecommunications company, \\nTalk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK), share \\nprice began to explode in April of this year moving from just \\nover $0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America \\nHoldings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but \\ntoday has a market cap of $267 million.\\nIGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. \\nUsing the TALK model for potential growth, IGTT could very well \\nbe trading in the .60 range in only a few months, with a market \\ncap in excess of $250 million. This would be an increase of 1000%. \\nSo you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time is right \\n for investors to get in on the ground floor.\\nÂ \\nThe InDigNet Strategy\\nInDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company \\nthat provides small to mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated \\ncommunication solution. InDigiNet is a prestigious \"Diamond\" \\nlevel partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for Cisco and \\nCompaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and \\nwireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the \\nCompany to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the \\ncapital burden of building a communication network. The Companyâ€™s \\nstrategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single market \\ncommunication companies and attractively priced Internet \\nService Providers (ISPs). The Company recently completed \\nits acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect. \\nInDigiNet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow \\nrevenue and enhance profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion \\nin commercial telephony, data services and technology spending, \\nor 33% of the countryâ€™s total market, and this spending \\nis expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years. \\nSource: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. \\nThe IGTT web site: www.indiginet.com\\nÂ \\nThe IT Market\\nBased on recent studies, the countryâ€™s 7.4 \\nmillion SMEs currently lag significantly in the utilization of \\nIT and data \\ncommunications, including Internet access, web services, business \\nsoftware and e-commerce. Worldwide IT spending increased to $981 \\nbillion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7 percent over \\n2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market researcher \\nIDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights, \\ngrowing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for \\nthe first time. In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in \\n2002 and 2003, IT spending in the US is expected to increase by \\n3 percent this year over 2001 to $436 billion, with further growth \\nof 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect growth of 4 percent \\nin 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will experience flat \\ngrowth levels this year, by next year growth in the market will \\nreturn to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown \\nin China, India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa \\nand Poland. Source: IDC\\nÂ \\nParticulars\\nThe Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our \\nStrong Buy/Aggressive Growth recommendation list for the following \\nreasons:\\n1. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer \\nbases of smaller, single-market communication companies and attractively \\npriced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell \\nits bundled service package to the acquired customer base that \\nwill form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all \\ntypes of communication services - local, long distance, wireless, \\nand data. 2. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front \\nRange communities but in particular the education vertical market \\nhas recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data \\nnetwork into the existing campus network. The Company's customers \\ninclude United States Olympic Committee \\n(USOC), University of Denver, \\nand Colorado State University. \\n3. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues \\nto acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy \\ncourt and smaller communication providers with valuable customer \\nbases. Each of the targeted companies are within the Company's \\nfootprint and will, subject to purchase completion, increase the \\nCompany's embedded customer base. \\nÂ \\nInvestment Consideration\\nInDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the \\nthree months ended March 31, 2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 \\nin Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1 2001. At this current growth \\nrate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for their first \\nyear of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more \\nand more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors \\nwill turn to small to mid-sized companies with their investment \\ndollars. \\nÂ \\nNEWS - InDigiNet, Inc.

As a result, I've had to rebuild the\\nmailing list from various other sources -- including the archives of\\npast list traffic.If you're a list subscriber, you may have received a \"welcome to the list\"\\nmail. All well and good.  However, if you *used* to be subscribed to one \\nof the lists at some point in 2002, or never were (I'm hoping that didn't\\nhappen!), you may have also have received one of these.  Just go to the\\nURL and click \"unsubscribe\", providing the password from the mail if\\nnecessary.If you're a list admin on any of the lists at lists.boxhost.net or\\ntaint.org, I'd appreciate if you could take a look and make sure the\\nsettings match up with what they used to be.Sorry about this :(--j.-- \\n'Justin Mason' => { url => 'http://jmason.org/', blog => 'http://taint.org/' }_______________________________________________\\nIIU mailing list\\nIIU@iiu.taint.org\\nhttp://iiu.taint.org/mailman/listinfo/iiu\\n   \n",

After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some \\ncarriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, \\nthe future may be dim. But for those survivors of the industry \\nthat have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems \\nmean opportunity. \"Every major industry in the history of \\nthe United States has experienced a similar transformation, from \\nthe railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the mid-1900s \\nto the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,\" says Robert \\nSaunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market \\nresearch firm. Christopher \\nDean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says \"We are seeing all \\nthe people that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money \\nand for the surviving carriers out there, they can get what used \\nto cost a few billion for a few millions.\" Read the full \\nstory from Telecommunications Magazine - See the link at the end \\nof this newsletter. \\nAs we write this report, our New Recommendation \\nInDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: \\nIGTT) has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since \\nlate May of 2002. As InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its \\nbusiness plan, we believe this company will help lead the way \\nup for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector. This could be our \\nstrongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our Highest \\nRating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.\\nÂ \\nGround Floor Opportunity / Tremendous \\nGrowth Potential \\nWe believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not \\ngreater than its competition. A similar telecommunications company, \\nTalk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK), share \\nprice began to explode in April of this year moving from just \\nover $0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America \\nHoldings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but \\ntoday has a market cap of $267 million.\\nIGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. \\nUsing the TALK model for potential growth, IGTT could very well \\nbe trading in the .60 range in only a few months, with a market \\ncap in excess of $250 million. This would be an increase of 1000%. \\nSo you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time is right \\n for investors to get in on the ground floor.\\nÂ \\nThe InDigNet Strategy\\nInDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company \\nthat provides small to mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated \\ncommunication solution. InDigiNet is a prestigious \"Diamond\" \\nlevel partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for Cisco and \\nCompaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and \\nwireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the \\nCompany to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the \\ncapital burden of building a communication network. The Companyâ€™s \\nstrategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single market \\ncommunication companies and attractively priced Internet \\nService Providers (ISPs). The Company recently completed \\nits acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect. \\nInDigiNet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow \\nrevenue and enhance profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion \\nin commercial telephony, data services and technology spending, \\nor 33% of the countryâ€™s total market, and this spending \\nis expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years. \\nSource: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. \\nThe IGTT web site: www.indiginet.com\\nÂ \\nThe IT Market\\nBased on recent studies, the countryâ€™s 7.4 \\nmillion SMEs currently lag significantly in the utilization of \\nIT and data \\ncommunications, including Internet access, web services, business \\nsoftware and e-commerce. Worldwide IT spending increased to $981 \\nbillion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7 percent over \\n2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market researcher \\nIDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights, \\ngrowing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for \\nthe first time. In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in \\n2002 and 2003, IT spending in the US is expected to increase by \\n3 percent this year over 2001 to $436 billion, with further growth \\nof 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect growth of 4 percent \\nin 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will experience flat \\ngrowth levels this year, by next year growth in the market will \\nreturn to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown \\nin China, India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa \\nand Poland. Source: IDC\\nÂ \\nParticulars\\nThe Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our \\nStrong Buy/Aggressive Growth recommendation list for the following \\nreasons:\\n1. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer \\nbases of smaller, single-market communication companies and attractively \\npriced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell \\nits bundled service package to the acquired customer base that \\nwill form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all \\ntypes of communication services - local, long distance, wireless, \\nand data. 2. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front \\nRange communities but in particular the education vertical market \\nhas recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data \\nnetwork into the existing campus network. The Company's customers \\ninclude United States Olympic Committee \\n(USOC), University of Denver, \\nand Colorado State University. \\n3. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues \\nto acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy \\ncourt and smaller communication providers with valuable customer \\nbases. Each of the targeted companies are within the Company's \\nfootprint and will, subject to purchase completion, increase the \\nCompany's embedded customer base. \\nÂ \\nInvestment Consideration\\nInDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the \\nthree months ended March 31, 2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 \\nin Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1 2001. At this current growth \\nrate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for their first \\nyear of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more \\nand more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors \\nwill turn to small to mid-sized companies with their investment \\ndollars. \\nÂ \\nNEWS - InDigiNet, Inc.

The CAMPAIGN\\n         FOR DIGITAL RIGHTS published its first in-depth analysis of\\n         the EUCD. For this exciting installment, CD-R has\\n         concentrated on what it does to people who have to\\n         circumvent copy protection to do their job. The short\\n         summary is: if they're not a teacher, a prison warder,\\n         disabled, or the cops, they can forget their jobs. If you're\\n         anyone else - like a musician, or a cryptographer -  and the\\n         copy protection says you can't make a backup, you can't. And\\n         even if you *are* a teacher or other exceptional person,\\n         you'll have to ask the Secretary of State if you can crack\\n         the protected CD. In writing. Each time.\\n         http://uk.eurorights.org/issues/eucd/ukimpl/\\n                                     - oh, don't worry, it gets worse\\n         http://www.stand.org.uk/weblog/archive/2002/08/21/000243.php\\n                                   - what you can do to stop all this         But there's plenty more to ooze out of the law than that.\\n         One of the big questions about the EUCD is \"is it the\\n         European DMCA, or what?\". Well, the DMCA spurted bad juice\\n         in many different directions, but one way in which the two\\n         are similiar is over \"circumvention devices\". Distributing\\n         DeCSS, the DVD lobby have claimed, is a crime under the\\n         DMCA. DeCSS is code that was also a magically dangerous\\n         artifact: a circumvention device. Circumvention devices are\\n         about to become illegal here. Specifically, three months in\\n         chokey (or two years if you really nark the judge), for\\n         those who \"distribute otherwise than in the course of a\\n         business to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the\\n         copyright owner\" one of them. \"Otherwise in the course of\\n         business\" is legalese for \"as an ordinary punter\", so it's\\n         not just mod-chip sellers who are liable. Anyone who\\n         distributes such satanic machines is also a perp.\\n         http://www.stand.org.uk/weblog/archive/2002/08/21/000243.php\\n                                   - what you can do to stop all this         That's not going to go down well with ANDREW SIMMONS.\\n         Regular NTK readers will remember Andrew as a lightning rod\\n         to lawyers. Not only was he John Doe #13 in the American\\n         DeCSS case, but in a completely unrelated affair, he waws\\n         threatened with all manner of nastiness just for publishing\\n         his list of doomed dotcoms on his Website [NTK 2000-09-22].\\n         In the last week, he's had another letter via Demon, finally\\n         ordering him to remove his shiny \"circumvention device\" (aka\\n         DeCSS) from his site. It sounds like the lawyers may have\\n         shot their wad a tad early: the EUCD rules don't kick in\\n         until Christmas. But when the new laws do hit, and if what\\n         Andrew's preposterous correspondent says is believed in a UK\\n         court, hosting DeCSS *will* mean jail. There's been some\\n         talk about how the EUCD rules are better than the DMCA,\\n         because they specifically exclude computer programs from the\\n         new rules. Well, it looks like DeCSS is no longer just a\\n         computer program.

With static object\\n&gt; allocation and a few other programming techniques, performance\\n&gt; differences disappear, but C++ gives a boost in development and\\n&gt; maintainability.Agreed, not much difference there. With C it just doesnt seem as wrong to\\nbe crawling around in registers and things. Quite frankly you cant fit\\n_that_ big of a project into a 32K ROM, so large project issues dont matter\\nas much in the embedded world.And in the realtime space, or when you have data coming in at 2Gbit/sec\\n[fibrechannel], every cycle DOES count.&gt; The real issue is compiler availability. Almost every embedded platform\\n&gt; has C cross-compilers. Many have C++ compilers. But there is still a\\n&gt; range of platforms that have the first but not the second. Or at least,\\n&gt; that was the story a few years ago.Definately still very very true.

For this exciting installment, CD-R has\\n         concentrated on what it does to people who have to\\n         circumvent copy protection to do their job. The short\\n         summary is: if they're not a teacher, a prison warder,\\n         disabled, or the cops, they can forget their jobs. If you're\\n         anyone else - like a musician, or a cryptographer -  and the\\n         copy protection says you can't make a backup, you can't. And\\n         even if you *are* a teacher or other exceptional person,\\n         you'll have to ask the Secretary of State if you can crack\\n         the protected CD. In writing.

Well, the DMCA spurted bad juice\\n         in many different directions, but one way in which the two\\n         are similiar is over \"circumvention devices\". Distributing\\n         DeCSS, the DVD lobby have claimed, is a crime under the\\n         DMCA. DeCSS is code that was also a magically dangerous\\n         artifact: a circumvention device. Circumvention devices are\\n         about to become illegal here. Specifically, three months in\\n         chokey (or two years if you really nark the judge), for\\n         those who \"distribute otherwise than in the course of a\\n         business to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the\\n         copyright owner\" one of them. \"Otherwise in the course of\\n         business\" is legalese for \"as an ordinary punter\", so it's\\n         not just mod-chip sellers who are liable. Anyone who\\n         distributes such satanic machines is also a perp.\\n         http://www.stand.org.uk/weblog/archive/2002/08/21/000243.php\\n                                   - what you can do to stop all this         That's not going to go down well with ANDREW SIMMONS.\\n         Regular NTK readers will remember Andrew as a lightning rod\\n         to lawyers. Not only was he John Doe #13 in the American\\n         DeCSS case, but in a completely unrelated affair, he waws\\n         threatened with all manner of nastiness just for publishing\\n         his list of doomed dotcoms on his Website [NTK 2000-09-22].\\n         In the last week, he's had another letter via Demon, finally\\n         ordering him to remove his shiny \"circumvention device\" (aka\\n         DeCSS) from his site. It sounds like the lawyers may have\\n         shot their wad a tad early: the EUCD rules don't kick in\\n         until Christmas. But when the new laws do hit, and if what\\n         Andrew's preposterous correspondent says is believed in a UK\\n         court, hosting DeCSS *will* mean jail. There's been some\\n         talk about how the EUCD rules are better than the DMCA,\\n         because they specifically exclude computer programs from the\\n         new rules. Well, it looks like DeCSS is no longer just a\\n         computer program.

With C it just doesnt seem as wrong to\\nbe crawling around in registers and things. Quite frankly you cant fit\\n_that_ big of a project into a 32K ROM, so large project issues dont matter\\nas much in the embedded world.And in the realtime space, or when you have data coming in at 2Gbit/sec\\n[fibrechannel], every cycle DOES count.> The real issue is compiler availability.

C++ compilers are still a rarity.\\n- Adam L. \"Duncan\" Beberg\\n  http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/\\n  beberg@mithral.com\\n   \n",
