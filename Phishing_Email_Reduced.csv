Kragen, do you know of any?I personally have FoRK delivered to an address (napier%waste.org)
that has SpamAssassin enabled, agressively, where it just nukes
anything it thinks is spam. Usually I figure if I miss a FoRK post,
no big deal, I'll pick it up by the replies if it's interesting.For personal mail (joe%barrera.org) I either don't use SpamAssassin,
or use it but where it just flags messages instead of nuking them.
So if someone is sending a message just to me, I'll get it even
if it looks like spam.So in other words, Rohit, if you had sent to joe%barrera.org, I
guess I would have received it in a timely fashion.So where's all that booze? When's the retry?

"" although pjm also conducted a "" best practices "" analysis , the other isos and ny tos do not agree with pjm ' s determinations of what practices from their isos are "" best practices . "" the judge acknowledges that support for option 3 - m ( the pjm plan ) "" far outstrips "" the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support . however , the judge believes that the pjm option assumes the pjm platform can work in new york and new england , even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in new york and new england than in pjm . the judge states that "" impatience , haste and greed "" should not be permitted to drive the rto process "" at the expense of sound policy "" and that optimal rto benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to "" exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint . "" see report , page 18 . governance the other substantive issues we have discussed are governance : interim governance , final governance , board make - up and stakeholder process . the judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead , he discusses the pros and cons of each option . here again , the judge strongly urges the commission to provide guidance to the participants on the commission ' s preferred governance approach . the judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures . pjm has stated that in order to meet its deadline of november 2003 ( and certainly earlier ) , pjm has to be in control of the implementation of the new rto . pjm proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing isos : 5 from pjm , 3 from new york , and 2 from new england . the board elects a voting ceo ( assumed to be phil harris if the pjm proposal wins ) . ny iso , new england iso , ny psc , ny tos and new england tos , along with other entities ( primarily those who are afraid to cross new york psc ) all support equal representation on the new board . one proposal would have 3 board members from each iso with a non - voting ceo . the other proposal would have 3 board members from each iso with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders . we support the pjm board make - up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single northeast rto and energy market based on the pjm system . post mediation the judge in his report recommends that the commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge . the judge urges the commission to not accept comments from participants , but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment . we are working on two sets of comments now , one on our own and one in conjunction with the one rto coalition . we will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared . although we are disappointed that the judge did not endorse the pjm proposal , we still believe that the commission is intent on implementing a single northeast rto as soon as possible and that the pjm proposal provides a well - reasoned ( even conservative ) approach to reaching that goal . therefore , even though the judge sided with new york , we are hopeful that the commission will stick to its guns and go with the pjm proposal . please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the report . sarah , dan , howard and tom",0

  Test the hub ports by switching cables around.
  Run ifconfig on the server - any errors and what kind they are.
  Test the network card... by replacing the thing!Seriously, if the server has a PCI slot free, something like a Realtek 8139
based card costs less than 20 euro.  The design is a couple of generations later
- more memory, less cruft, no *FSCKING* dos config utility, no jumpers on the
card and it's PCI.  Ronan.

FreeBSD only:   NOI.   BackgroundThe Network File System (NFS) allows a host to export some or all of
its filesystems, or parts of them, so that other hosts can access them
over the network and mount them as if they were on local disks.  NFS is
built on top of the Sun Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework.II.  Problem DescriptionA part of the NFS server code charged with handling incoming RPC
messages had an error which, when the server received a message with a
zero-length payload, would cause it to reference the payload from the
previous message, creating a loop in the message chain.  This would
later cause an infinite loop in a different part of the NFS server
code which tried to traverse the chain.III. ImpactCertain Linux implementations of NFS produce zero-length RPC messages
in some cases.  A FreeBSD system running an NFS server may lock up
when such clients connect.An attacker in a position to send RPC messages to an affected FreeBSD
system can construct a sequence of malicious RPC messages that cause
the target system to lock up.IV.  Workaround1) Disable the NFS server: set the nfs_server_enable variable to ""NO""
   in /etc/rc.conf, and reboot.   Alternatively, if there are no active NFS clients (as listed by the
   showmount(8) utility), just killing the mountd and nfsd processes
   should suffice.2) Add firewall rules to block RPC traffic to the NFS server from
   untrusted hosts.V.   SolutionThe following patch has been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.4, 4.5, and
4.6 systems.a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:36/nfs.patch

 and reboot the
system.VI.  Correction detailsThe following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was

I poked around expedia for availability from March 26 to 29 (4 nights, wednesday thorugh saturday). I've also started contacting hotels for group rates; some of the group rates are no better than the regular rates, and they require signing a contract with a minimum number of rooms sold (with someone financially responsible for unbooked rooms). Most hotels are less than responsive... Radission - Barcelo Hotel (DuPont Circle) $125/night, $99/weekend State Plaza hotel (Foggy Bottom; near GWU) $119/night, $99/weekend Hilton Silver Spring (Near Metro, in suburban MD) $99/hight, $74/weekend Windsor Park Hotel Conn Ave, between DuPont Circle/Woodley Park Metro stations $95/night; needs a car Econo Lodge Alexandria (Near Metro, in suburban VA) $95/nightThis is a hand picked list; I ignored anything over $125/night, even though there are some really well situated hotels nearby at higher rates. Also, I'm not sure how much these prices reflect an expedia-only discount. I can't vouch for any of these hotels, either.I also found out that the down season for DC Hotels are mid-june through mid-september, and mid-november through mid-january.Z. """"""This one has no MIME structure nor HTML! It even has a Content-disposition which is counted as a non-spam clue. It got f-p'ed because of the many hospitality-related and money-related terms. I'm surprised $125/night and similar aren't clues too.

The first one's a doozie (that's the term, right? :-). It has lots of HTML clues that are apparently ignored. It was a multipart/mixed with two parts: a brief text/plain part containing one or two sentences, a mondo weird URL:http://x60.deja.com/[ST_rn=ps]/getdoc.xp?AN=687715863&CONTEXT=973121507.1408827441&hitnum=23and some employer-generated spammish boilerplate; the second part was the HTML taken directly from the above URL.

"" but no names or references . ) what happened was that early last week a petition signed by 403 residents of westfield , mass . was given to the school board in response to a decision to reassign two bilingual education teachers to positions as normal classroom teachers . the petition urges that no teacher be assigned to first or second grades "" who is not thoroughly proficient in the english language in terms of grammar , syntax , and - most important - the accepted and standardized use of pronunciation . "" the mayor of the city , a greek immigrant with an accent , and a proponent of english - only laws , and chair of the city 's school committee , has been vocally in favor of the petition . it has been denounced by the state 's secretary of education , piedad robertson , a native of cuba and a former kindergarten teacher herself , who immediately came out with the statement that the proposal "" would appear to be discrimination , plain and simple . . . . this petition , instead of fostering the acceptance of cultural diversity , would appear to encourage bigotry , racism , and discrimination . "" the mayor in a phone interview june 30 dismissed her attack as "" bovine scatology . "" the state 's attorney general has offered th opinion that the plan would almost certainly violate the state 's anti-discrimination laws . an article today ( both articles i ' m quoting from are in the daily hampshire gazette , of northampton , though there was also a mention in sunday 's nytimes ) says the mayor , george varelas , says he has been getting calls from all over the country , mostly agreeing with his point of view . the two parents who started the drive are expressing great surprise ; the wife , "" who is of spanish and portuguese descent , has become so distraught over accusations of bigotry . . . that she has taken to avoiding people . "" the city has about 36000 population and a broad ethnic mix . but like most of what one reads about the english only movement , there 's a great deal of debate about whether it 's racist or xenophobic , etc . , and very little about the fundamental question that you raised , namely does it in fact have any effect on the acquisition of english by the children in the classes ? "" throughout last week , i was forwarding the responses to barbara and she was updating the story as things evolved . on july the 8th , she was contacted by a reporter of the westfield paper , and she asked me for ( and , of course , received ) permission to use the materials i had in her interview with the paper . on july the 9th , barbara wrote : "" by the way , i heard second hand that the school committee or a subcommittee thereof just voted this morning 3 - 0 not to adopt the petitioners ' request . i ' ll know more by this evening 's news . i expect the newspaper article that our stuff went to will appear tomorrow morning . i ' ll let you know . this is happening quicker , and coming out more emphatically on the right side , than i had expected . "" the article appeared on friday , july the 10th , and barbara is likely to post it here on monday . as you will see , the reporter was absolutely fascinated by the fact of the ongoing worldwide discussion of the issue on a computer net . the same issue of the same paper ran a syndicated column by william raspberry on the subject . i have not yet found a paper available here that runs bill raspberry . that was the chronicle , and now for the substance of the responses . a couple of people suggested that the petitioners ' concern was about the teachers being comprehensible to the grade school students . this is , of course , a most legitimate concern , and many states , school corporations , and universities have taken measures to protect their students from incompetent english speakers . apparently , however , this was not the petitioners ' concern , and the core of the issue was their belief that the students would acquire the foreign accent of a teacher . all the responses on this subject shared the conviction that it could not happen . michael covington ( mcovingt @ uga . cc . uga . edu ) : "" my own rather limited experience is that children are n't even influenced by the foreign accents of their _ parents _ , much less teachers . "" cliff miller ( miller @ defun . cs . utah . edu ) : "" of course it is possible [ for a grade school student to be influenced by the teacher 's foreign accent ] , but it is highly unlikely that it will be complete or long-lasting . and perhaps the more important question is : does it matter ? i grew up in several different places and my english has undergone a number of shifts - - i even had a japanese accent for a while . my english is quite native now and i do n't think that the different stages it went through did it any harm . . . . "" craig thiersch ( thiersch @ kub . nl ) : "" i ' m afraid i do n't have any citations from linguistics literature , and our phonologist is n't here today , but you ' re right : it 's more or less common knowledge that children virtually always acquire the accent of their peers , not that of parents , teachers , or other adults . i can think of countless examples from my own experience : for instance , i used to live in boston , where you can cut the local accent with a knife , and played organ for a church in arlington , mass . , where the pastor and his wife were from the mid - west . but all their children had strong "" towny "" arlington accents . "" amy sheldon ( asheldon @ vx . acs . umn . edu ) : "" i was interested in learning that your daughter never acquired the pronunciations of the 3 adults at home , when they differed from , i assume , the local dialect . i can add that our 9 & 12 year olds do not have any of their father 's quebec french pronunciations or translations in their speech and on occasions when they have had his speech forms / usage , they seem to get rid of it when they learn the local dialect . that is , his speech does not persist in theirs . they also recently asked me if i thought that daddy had a foreign accent . they said they did n't think so . i must admit , that i have to stop and think a second before i realize that he does indeed have an accent , and that on reflection , our kids will admit to it too . but there is a sense in which we do n't think on a minute to minute basis of him as speaking differently from us , though certain pronunciations or translations on occasion may strike us noticeably . i 'd imagine that students in a class with a nonnative teacher muight have the same perceptions , esp . if the teacher is fluent in english , although having an accent . this is a good "" applied linguistics "" example . "" the only references that the discussion has yielded so far were contributed by catherine doughty and susan ervin - tripp . catherine doughty ( catherine . doughty @ linguistics . su . edu . au ) : "" the ability "" to be affected by phonology "" seems to be the earliest of thing to go in terms of maturational constraints on language acquisition - - see the work of johnson & newport 1989 in cognitive psychology 21 . j & n set the age of the beginning of the decline at 5 or 6 . another interesting case that is analogous in some ways but not others is the case of simon a profoundly deaf child of profoundly deaf parents . simon 's parents were late acquirers of asl ( learned at ages 16 & 15 ) and so provided non-native and very different versions of asl to their child . they are his only source of input , as simon goes to a "" normal "" school where no one knows any asl . simon 's asl is comparable to the asl of children who learn asl from native signers - - e . g . , nativelike . ( singleton 1989 dissertation ) . susan ervin - tripp ( ervin-tr @ cogsci . berkeley . edu ) : "" it would be nearly impossible for a child to be influenced by the accent of a grade school teacher unless it was the prestige accent of the community , and the child knew it . as labov showed convincingly , kids get their accents from their peers . on the other hand , i ran into some reported cases of children who preserved the accents of their immigrant parents , but these were unusual cases of socially isolated children . for example , in the clinical literature i found a case of an 8 year old who immigrated at 3 , and still had "" his father 's accent "" . as he was psychoanalyzed ( ! ) he lost his accent , spoke like his peers , and became able to mimic the accent at will . buxbaum , psychoanalytic quarterly , 18 , 279-289 ( 1949 ) .

4784,"Hi All,Anyone ever try connecting at 1200bps in Linux? I've got a USR 56K
Faxmodem which is meant to connect to another (same) modem and I have to
connect at this speed due to the (NT) port settings on the remote side,
but the modem handshake always fails at this speed.The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to
~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote server
as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps.Note Minicom fails to handshake at 1200bps, but HyperTerm in Windows
worked first time(!?), any ideas?Baud 1200 7 data bits Even ParityI am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string:AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1... which is most of the defaults.USR said to set S15=128 (disables v.42)) 
& set S32=98 (disable v.92 & X2)But the S15=128 just makes the handshake lockup instead of just giving
up.btw this is a bank's system I am connecting to so reconfiguring their
modems may be difficult.Colin.

                              here falls shoe two         Well, it's getting late, and the government hasn't fallen,
         so we better roll the presses on the bad news. The CAMPAIGN
         FOR DIGITAL RIGHTS published its first in-depth analysis of
         the EUCD. For this exciting installment, CD-R has
         concentrated on what it does to people who have to
         circumvent copy protection to do their job. The short
         summary is: if they're not a teacher, a prison warder,
         disabled, or the cops, they can forget their jobs. If you're
         anyone else - like a musician, or a cryptographer -  and the
         copy protection says you can't make a backup, you can't. And
         even if you *are* a teacher or other exceptional person,
         you'll have to ask the Secretary of State if you can crack
         the protected CD. In writing. Each time.

                                   - what you can do to stop all this         But there's plenty more to ooze out of the law than that.
         One of the big questions about the EUCD is ""is it the
         European DMCA, or what?"". Well, the DMCA spurted bad juice
         in many different directions, but one way in which the two
         are similiar is over ""circumvention devices"". Distributing
         DeCSS, the DVD lobby have claimed, is a crime under the
         DMCA. DeCSS is code that was also a magically dangerous
         artifact: a circumvention device. Circumvention devices are
         about to become illegal here. Specifically, three months in
         chokey (or two years if you really nark the judge), for
         those who ""distribute otherwise than in the course of a
         business to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the
         copyright owner"" one of them. ""Otherwise in the course of
         business"" is legalese for ""as an ordinary punter"", so it's
         not just mod-chip sellers who are liable. Anyone who
         distributes such satanic machines is also a perp.

         to lawyers. Not only was he John Doe #13 in the American
         DeCSS case, but in a completely unrelated affair, he waws
         threatened with all manner of nastiness just for publishing
         his list of doomed dotcoms on his Website [NTK 2000-09-22].
         In the last week, he's had another letter via Demon, finally
         ordering him to remove his shiny ""circumvention device"" (aka
         DeCSS) from his site. It sounds like the lawyers may have
         shot their wad a tad early: the EUCD rules don't kick in
         until Christmas. But when the new laws do hit, and if what
         Andrew's preposterous correspondent says is believed in a UK
         court, hosting DeCSS *will* mean jail. There's been some
         talk about how the EUCD rules are better than the DMCA,
         because they specifically exclude computer programs from the
         new rules. Well, it looks like DeCSS is no longer just a
         computer program. From now on, it could become a special ""nick me""
         tag for your Website.

         in DNA-testing murder cases, and search-engines look even
         stupider when they suggest ""relevant documents"" - but it's
         getting a bit of a re-renaissance in the spam filtering
         world. Tradition states Naive Bayesian alone doesn't work
         well enough at filtering by example, so it's good to see
         dozens of people independently sloshing around the noospere
         looking for better tweaked solutions. Including, of course,
         leading noosphere cadet ERIC S RAYMOND, whose Bayesian

They weigh 125 kg.You need high energy per unit mass, and the capacitive system I picked maximizes that.It is precisely the system that Maxwell is touting for electrical braking and power augmentation for regenerative use in automobiles. You also need voltage you can use in a DC motor, which is why though the actual capacitors in the system are charged to 2.5 volts, the system has them arranged in series to boost the voltage.Ignore him.

That must be why 40kV is standard not 42. (the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW)Most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few real world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were talking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the ""capactior is the wrong choice"" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one, it's got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady discharge curve.But it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, not the 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For those you dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole atoms, not just electrons. Then you can suck off the electrons you need with a fuel cell. However, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel, and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design.- Adam L.

"" i know ( traders ) are getting a ton of calls , but i don ' t think there is going to be a mass exodus from the trading floor , "" said joe baker , president of houston - based search consultants international , a recruitment company that serves the energy and power marketing industry . enron , known for turning out some of the industry ' s most aggressive traders , also has a reputation as a tough training ground for newcomers , handsomely rewarding those who "" make their numbers "" and quickly showing non - performers the door . traders at other energy firms said experienced traders can earn six - figures salaries before annual bonuses , paid sometime between the beginning of january and the middle of march . a company recruiting traders before the bonus is paid would have to pay a larger sign on bonus . "" the majority of the key traders are going to wait and see what kind of situation develops . . . everyone ' s got their eyes open , "" baker said . "" most people want to stick around to see what kind of bonus they are going to get . "" wait and see energy traders are clearly worried about the $ 9 billion takeover announced last week , an opportunity for dynegy to chop head count . "" there ' s a lot of overlap at both firms . i don ' t think there will be enough room for everyone , "" a trader at another texas - based energy firm said . enron is the nation ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity . dynegy is about a fifth as big as enron measured in terms of revenue . despite the job uncertainty hanging over their heads , traders said they could not name a single enron or dynegy trader actively scouting out a new employer . "" everyone seems to be waiting to see what happens . there are only a few trader jobs open in the country right now . those positions will likely be filled pretty quickly if this merger goes through , "" another trader said . "" some ( traders ) are going to be looking for work no matter whether they ' re laid off or leave on their own , "" the trader added . so far , it is mostly enron support staff who are polishing off their resumes . enron said wednesday in an analyst meeting the company expects to take a charge for severance in the fourth quarter . however , no job cut numbers were discussed . baker said the support staff feels their jobs are the ones most threatened by the proposed dynegy merger . dynegy is buying enron for its trading operation and has said it is confident the best will stick around . upon completion of the merger , the combined company , to be called dynegy inc . , is expected to have revenues exceeding $ 200 billion and $ 90 billion in assets . dynegy agreed to buy its larger cross - town rival after enron investors lost faith in the company whose stock plummeted following its disclosure of off - balance sheet deals with partnerships run by its former chief financial officer . the stock was off 8 cents , or 0 . 8 percent , at $ 9 . 92 a share at the close on new york stock exchange trade wednesday , well below its 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 . meanwhile , dynegy stock fell $ 1 . 58 , or 0 . 7 percent , to $ 46 . 20 a share . - scott disavino , new york power desk , + 646 - 223 - 6072 , fax + 646 - 223 - 6079 , e - mail scott . disavino @ reuters . com and nigel hunt , los angeles bureau + 213 - 955 - 6752 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : arbs tread lightly on enron - dynegy deal . by dane hamilton 11 / 14 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . new york , nov 14 ( reuters ) - merger arbitragers say they ' re treading lightly in betting over prospects for the $ 9 billion stock - swap takeover of houston energy trader enron corp . by rival dynegy inc . . these market pros , who bet on the likelihood a merger will be completed , say big questions about enron ' s financial condition raise doubts about the deal and make them shy about risking heavy bets . wednesday ' s conference call between enron officials and investors did little to assuage that , they say . "" people are very nervous about enron , "" said one arb at a major new york brokerage . "" they aren ' t sure if enron is actually earning anything . "" arbs who think a deal will eventually be completed may "" short "" the acquirer and buy target stock , reasoning that the acquirer ' s stock will fall and the target will rise on completion . but in recent days , enron ' s stock has languished , while dynegy ' s stock has gained more than 40 percent , although it was close to the same level a month ago . some arbs said dynegy ' s stock may have risen because it could gain valuable pipeline assets whether or not a deal is completed . enron said it granted dynegy an option to buy its northern natural gas pipeline system for less than $ 975 million if the deal falls apart after the months - long due diligence review . "" now dynegy has up to a year to look at the company and at worst , dynegy comes away with a very good deal , "" said one arb . "" even if it ' s a disaster , they come away with a very valuable pipeline . "" once a wall street high - flyer boasting a $ 90 share price just 15 months ago , enron fell from grace after off - balance sheet transactions and financial reporting lapses prompted a regulatory investigation and senior official resignations . looming debt and a collapsing share price led enron to agree to a takeover by smaller houston rival dynegy last week then valued at $ 10 . 41 a share , a fraction of its former value . enron officials on wednesday said they were confident that the company was close to gaining a clear picture of its financial condition following restatement of earnings over several years . but it said the securities and exchange commission investigation "" could affect us on a go - forward basis .

( adds analyst comment and details of lay compensation paragraphs 5 to 7 ) by andrew kelly houston , nov 14 ( reuters ) - enron corp . chairman and chief executive ken lay on wednesday acknowledged misjudgments and errors that pushed the nation ' s biggest energy trader to the brink of collapse and forced it to accept a humbling buyout by smaller rival dynegy inc . in a stunning mea culpa to analysts and investors , lay admitted that enron had made bad investments , overburdened itself with debt and conducted deals that led to conflicts of interest now under u . s . regulatory investigation . "" we fully understand and regret that the combination of these events has resulted in the complete loss of investor confidence . we are fully committed to fixing the problems , "" he said . lay ' s act of atonement came after enron said he had decided to waive his right to a $ 60 million golden parachute as part of dynegy ' s planned buyout , following a tense exchange with employees about his severance package on tuesday . lay received a base salary of $ 1 . 3 million from enron for 2000 plus bonuses totaling $ 10 . 6 million . he has also made several million dollars this year by exercising options and selling enron stock at prices which mostly ranged from $ 40 to $ 60 , according to enron filings . ubs warburg analyst ron barone said lay ' s candor could not undo damage already done but was welcome nevertheless . "" the fact that he ' fessed up ' is a step toward reestablishing credibility in himself and in the company , "" barone said . enron agreed on friday to be taken over by dynegy for about $ 9 billion in stock , after investor unease over enron ' s off - balance sheet deals drove its stock price down to $ 7 last week from a high of $ 90 . 56 in august 2000 . "" in hindsight , we made some very bad investments in non - core businesses , "" lay said in a 90 - minute conference call . many of those investments , such as an ill - fated venture into the water services business and a power plant project in india that became mired in a payments dispute , performed below enron ' s worst expectations , lay said . "" the negative impact of these investments have been exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off the balance sheet , "" lay said . deals between enron and partnerships run by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow , produced "" various conflicts of interest , both real and perceived , "" he added . fastow was recently replaced and the deals with the partnerships are now under investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission . lay , who built enron into the dominant energy trading company in north america and europe after it was formed by the merger of two natural gas pipeline companies in 1986 , said the core wholesale energy businesses were fundamentally sound . in the short term , he said , enron will focus on preventing further deterioration of its credit ratings and maintaining sufficient liquidity to keep the energy businesses running . enron ' s president and chief operating officer , greg whalley , said the company expects its recent woes to have a "" temporary but negative impact "" on profitability . whalley told analysts and investors that fourth - quarter results would also be adversely affected by severance costs and other restructuring costs . he did not provide details but said enron will issue earnings guidance in two to three weeks . the reference to severance costs was the first allusion to job cuts that are widely viewed as inevitable . enron also said it is seeking an additional $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in private equity to help rebuild confidence in the company and keep its core trading operations afloat in the nine months before the acquisition by dynegy is expected to close . it has already received $ 1 . 5 billion in cash from oil company chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26 . 5 percent of dynegy . enron has been under heavy fire from wall street since mid - october when it said shareholder equity had been cut by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals with the fastow partnerships . dynegy has said that its agreement with enron would allow it to back out of the acquisition if the company ' s problems , which include a stack of lawsuits from angry investors , turn out to be far worse than has already been disclosed . however , dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson has said he is confident this will not happen . watson will head the combined company , which will retain the dynegy name , and dynegy will dominate the combined company ' s senior management and board of directors . lay has said he has not yet made up his mind whether to accept watson ' s offer of a seat on the board of the new company . the california public employees retirement system ( calpers ) , the largest u . s . pension fund , said there should be no place for lay or any other enron directors on the new dynegy board .

( cvx ) , is aimed at providing enron with additional cash liquidity to support its core energy marketing and trading operations . the rights provide dynegy with the option to acquire the pipeline unit should the two companies fail to complete their merger . the deal , which still needs shareholder and regulatory approval , is expected to close within the next six to nine months . dynegy is acquiring enron for 0 . 2685 of a dynegy share , or about $ 10 billion based on the recent price of dynegy shares . the acquisition of enron by its smaller rival follows a series of disclosures about enron ' s financial dealings with partnerships run by some of its corporate officers . the dealings are under investigation by the securities and exchange commission and at the center of more than a dozen of shareholder lawsuits . during the last month , enron watched as its share price sunk to a small fraction of its earlier levels as shareholder confidence in the trading company evaporated . as credit - rating agencies began to cut enron ' s debt ratings threatening the company ' s investment - grade status , the company scrambled to raise additional cash to shore up its balance sheet and protect confidence in its business . industry experts viewed dynegy ' s cash infusion as one way the companies sought to bolster confidence in the energy trader ' s liquidity , and protect its most valuable business . in a conference call earlier wednesday , enron said its core energy trading business has been temporarily hurt by the uncertainty created by recent events . according to dynegy spokeswoman jennifer rosser , the preferred stock dynegy has received for its investment in enron is convertible into the common stock of the enron pipeline unit . dynegy also has the right to convert the preferred stock into enron shares if it desires , the spokeswoman said . for example , if enron were to cancel its merger with dynegy in order to accept a higher bid from another suitor , dynegy might decide to convert its preferred shares into enron stock in order to reap the profits created by an increase in enron ' s stock price , rosser said . in either case , dynegy wouldn ' t be required to pay any additional consideration . dynegy was able to make the cash infusion after chevrontexaco , of san francisco , made an investment in dynegy . if the acquisition closes as anticipated , chevrontexaco , which owns about one - fourth of dynegy , plans to make an additional $ 1 billion investment in the combined company . chevrontexaco also has the right to purchase an additional $ 1 . 5 billion in dynegy stock in the first three years following the close of the acquisition . enron officials said they are monitoring the energy market ' s reaction to the cash infusion , and hopes it will restore the confidence of its counterparties . enron remains on a credit watch at the credit - rating agencies . moody ' s investors service and standard 201 - 938 - 5166 ; christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : enron queried by epa on oil pipeline spills . 11 / 14 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . washington , nov 14 ( reuters ) - the nation ' s biggest energy trader , enron corp . , already reeling from bad investments , too much debt and possible conflicts of interest , said on wednesday that the government is seeking information on spills from pipelines operated by enron and its subsidiaries . in a filing with the securities and exchange commission , the houston - based company said it received a request for information from the environmental protection agency regarding certain spills and discharges since 1998 on oil pipelines operated by enron and its subsidiaries . eott energy partners llp is the only subsidiary of enron that has extensive domestic oil pipeline operations , according to the filing . enron ' s response was originally supposed to be filed with the epa no later than nov . 7 , but it received an extension until jan . 31 . "" eott cannot predict the outcome of the epa inquiry , "" the company said in the filing . enron agreed on friday to be taken over by dynegy inc . for about $ 9 billion in stock after investor unease over off - balance sheet deals drove its stock price down to $ 7 last week from a high of $ 90 . 56 in august 2000 . many of those investments , such as an ill - fated venture into the water services business and a power plant project in india that became mired in a payments dispute , performed below enron ' s worst expectations , kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive officer , said on wednesday . in addition , deals between enron and partnerships run by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow , produced "" various conflicts of interest , both real and perceived , "" he added . fastow was recently replaced , and the deals with the partnerships are now under investigation by the sec . enron shares were down 3 cents to $ 9 . 96 while dynegy lost 48 cents to $ 46 . 46 , both in afternoon trading on the new york stock exchange . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron to sell off money - losing assets in bid to restore its financial health 11 / 14 / 2001 dow jones business news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) a wall street journal online news roundup houston - - enron corp . , the once - mighty energy trader , is shedding money - losing assets and focusing on its core power - marketing business as it moves toward a merger with rival dynegy inc . the effort is aimed at improving enron ' s financial health , following disclosures that the company inflated profit figures and didn ' t reveal large amounts of debt to shareholders , enron president and chief executive kenneth lay told investors wednesday . businesses enron ( ene ) wants to sell include a high - speed internet unit and power operations in india and brazil , which mr . lay said "" have performed far worse than we ever could have imagined when we made these investments .

"" under regulatory guidelines , publicly traded companies have 45 days from the end of a fiscal quarter to file their financial results with the sec . enron reported its third - quarter earnings in mid - october , but has yet to make a filing with the sec . the filing would include enron ' s balance sheet . in the past , enron has received criticism for not providing a balance sheet with its quarterly earnings release . enron officials on the call declined to provide specific details about the company ' s current cash position . that information is included on the balance sheet . dynegy agreed to buy enron after the energy - trading giant ' s stock price plunged about 80 % in the weeks following enron ' s posting of a $ 618 million third - quarter loss . dynegy also will assume $ 13 billion of enron ' s debt . the slide in enron ' s share price primarily was a result of large - scale transactions it did with partnerships headed by enron officers . those transactions have produced hundreds of millions of dollars of write - offs and restatements in the past month . they are being investigated by the sec and have helped spawn more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits . enron ousted its chief financial officer , andrew fastow , who ran some of the partnerships , and restated its earnings back to 1997 . but those actions failed to restore investor confidence . "" i could not have ever contemplated the events we as a company and you as a stakeholder have faced over the last several weeks , "" mr . lay said wednesday .

too) just does a move (rather than select as target without moving).Of course, if you can manage to get no messages currently selected, then
it works fine.  | 2) In the main window, the ""+"" key puts you into a ""change 
  |    folder"" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
  |    hit a second + and you go to ""set a target"" mode.  Type a few
  |    characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.This works, but is not nice if you're not using the keyboard, but just
the mouse.Tony: I agree - a nice way to link in one click would be good, and should
be easy to add, though currently adding mouse bindings (something like
shift right click would be a good choice) is much harder than adding
key bindings.But note there's no need to ""undo"" - the way I generally use link, if
the desired destination folder isn't the current selected target, is
to right click on the target, which selects it and moves the message,
(and because I have the ""automatic move to the next message on move or
link option set) select the message again, and then ""Link"".Exmh only permits one uncomitted action to be selected for a message at a
time, that is, one of delete, move, or link.   Selecting any of those
implicitly undoes any previous choice from the three (so you cannot
achieve a ""move"" by doing a link, then delete, then commit, it needs to
be link, commit, delete, commit).  (xmh was just the same there incidentally).  | How's spring shaping up ""down under""?No meaningful comment from me, I'm not there at the minute.   But I'm told
that where I'm from it is cold, wet, and miserable, though has been better
during the day (sunny days, cold nights) for the past few.    In any case,
all of that is a good enough reason to stay away...kre_______________________________________________

15039,"Here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with 
no reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to 
be that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la 
Wilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, 
ev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more 
partners than women.  I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether 
the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely 
promiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get 
even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other 
men. 
http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html<>
As for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme 
promiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the 
Band Played On. He writes about  bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses 
how, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you 
might call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having 
many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an 
explicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.
    That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of 
Schiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played 
in spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many 
others. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that 
there was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.Tom

2480,"interesting article interesting article , especially since it came from britain . . . it does mention enron too . the next global city ? the blob that ate east texas jun 21 st 2001 houston from the economist print edition ( june 23 , 2001 ) for most outsiders , texas is a foreign country . its biggest city , though , might surprise the rest of the world when a texan in a big hat tells you how wonderful his home town is , reach for the salt . bob lanier , the former mayor of houston , isn ' t actually wearing a stetson as he gazes from his penthouse down on a city that sprawls 25 miles away in every direction . but metaphorically he is . houston , he claims , could become one of the great cities of the world . the remarkable thing is that he might be right . from the time the city was founded in 1836 until the 1970 s , houston doubled in size almost every decade . then , despite one of the deepest slumps any city had experienced since the 1930 s , the metropolitan area managed to add lm people in the 1990 s to grow to 4 . 7 m , making houston the fourth - largest city in america . it is already bigger than berlin and , with a gdp of around $ 215 billion a year , has a larger economy than hong kong . because it is the nearest metropolis to the cities of northern mexico , it may attract another 2 m people over the next two decades , which would give it almost the same size of population as london has now . but a global city ? these are few and far between . houston can hardly dream of becoming a global financial centre like london , new york or tokyo . but its business leaders think it could become a cosmopolitan , entrepreneurial hub , a hong kong , a san francisco or even a new los angeles . it shares la ' s smog , its sprawl , its latino culture , even its ugly hubris ; and by some measures it surpasses la ' s ability to reinvent its economy . can it use its adaptability to turn itself into a properly international place ? oil be there for you its hopes still depend disproportionately on its most global industry . energy accounts for half of houston ' s economy . during the 1970 s , while the rest of america stagflated , houston boomed as high oil prices sucked billions into the country ' s oil capital . in that decade alone , the city built almost as much new office space as the total amount of commercial property available in san francisco . money was being lent and business plans formed on the assumption that oil would go to $ 50 a barrel . at the height of the boom , about 80 % of the city ' s economy was oil - related . the bust was traumatic . by the mid - 1980 s , all that new office space stood empty . every big local bank was taken over . only one of the property developers then in business is left . unsurprisingly , a certain paranoia lingers in the city about the oil business . the greater houston partnership , the main business lobby , has spent the past 20 years frantically encouraging the city to diversify . yet the fact is that the energy business and houston itself have emerged stronger from the terrible bust . as company after company was forced to cut back , they collapsed their operations back into houston and seem unlikely to be dispersed again . in 1999 , when oil slumped to $ 10 a barrel and the number of oil rigs in america fell to its lowest point in living memory , houston still managed to add energy jobs . now another boom is in prospect , with oil prices high again . matt simmonds , the head of a local energy consultancy , argues that america ' s past reluctance to build new power plants will force it to increase energy capacity by around 30 % in the next ten or 15 years . the rig count is already 50 % above last year , and natural gas exploration is soaring . if oil prices stay high ( a big if ) and if other countries share america ' s energy worries , houston will grow in importance . it is hampered by a wild - catting reputation . in fact , the energy business is changing in three significant ways , and houston is the centre of all of them . first , technology . not long ago , oil drills went down to 1 , 500 feet ( 457 metres ) . now they go to 15 , 000 feet . companies use four - dimensional computer imaging to plan new fields ( time is the fourth ) . this is making oil an information - intensive business and puts a premium on the kinds of skills available in houston . second , the cost of new oilfield exploration and development has risen so far that even newly merged behemoths cannot always finance them alone . this makes deal - making vital , which is good for the city where deals are made . if you are not attending , say , lunch at houston ' s petroleum club , you are out of the loop . third and most important , oil is now only part of a bigger energy business , which includes electricity . once divided into self - contained regional markets run by local utilities , the electricity business is being changed by the gradual emergence of a national grid dominated by power producers and traders . big users now decide whether to buy power at long - or short - term rates , rather as they arrange their financing . a new business of energy arbitraging is emerging , and itscentre is houston . three of the five new skyscrapers going up downtown have as their main tenants energy companies that did not exist ten years ago . one of them , enron , is building a 50 , 000 - square - foot trading floor ? ? single - company answer to the chicago board of trade . enron has probably been houston ' s most successful energy company of the past ten years . it has never explored for , pumped up , or refined a single drop ofoil . out of the black stuff however well - placed houston is to take advantage of the energy business , it will never be a great city as a one - trick pony . its boosters point to other strengths : * trade . houston is america ' ssecond largest port , which is remarkable considering it is 50 miles from the sea . * computers . the city is home to compaq , america ' s third - largest pc maker . if you include dell , based in austin , two of america ? ? four big computer firms are in south - east texas , not silicon valley . * space . the national aeronautics and space administration centre is in houston , thanks to lyndonjohnson , a native son . * medicine . houston is home to probably the largest medical complex in the world . in a moment of extraordinary optimism , the city set aside 700 acres in the middle of town for medicine . the hospitals , clinics and research centres of the texas medical centre employ 55 , 000 people and deal with 70 , 000 patients a day . st luke ' s has performed more heart surgery than any other hospital in the world . md anderson and the texas children ' s hospital are among the top two in their respective specialities , cancerand paediatrics . this list has holes in it . houston has no real financial services ( the mainstay of the biggest global cities ) or pharmaceuticals ( despite the medical centre ) . and some of its new industries are less robust than the boosters claim . its port ' s success depends on the vagaries of mexico ' s economy . space does not employ many people and is unlikely to grow until the far - off day when the commercialisation of space arrives . the texas medical centre is set up on a not - for - profit basis , so it has not been able to commercialise its activities ( hence the lack of drug firms ) , though a new biotechnology park may help . in fact , houston ' s main hope for diversifying lies not so much in particular sectors as in something intangible : its stunning ability to create new firms . for the past three years , houston has created more new companies than any city in america . it is almost certainly the best place either to start a business or find a first - time job . the reasons for this are the real driving forces behind its success . the beauty of entrepreneurialism the first is unmeasurable , a no - holds - barred optimism of the old school . one survey shows that about two - thirds of americans agree with the assertion that if you work hard in this city , eventually you will succeed . but houston ' s figure even at the bottom of the city ' s recession was 75 % , and now it is 88 % , the highest - ever , and ( says the survey ' s author , stephen klineberg of rice university ) the highest of any bigamerican city . it may not be true that anything is possible in houston , but people act as if it were . bill gilmer , the chief economist of the houston branch of the federal reserve system , argues that this explains why houston recovered so fast from the oil bust : unemployed engineers went out and set up their own firms , just as aerospace engineers did in los angeles when the end of the cold war put them out of business . the second advantage is technical . uniquely for an american metropolis , houston has no citywide zoning ordinances . when planning decisions are made , they are made by developers on their own land . for the would - be entrepreneur , it is thus easier and cheaper to find a place to set up shop in houston than in any other city in america . lack of zoning laws hands power to developers who insist that new developments be large to capture economies of scale . they expand in leapfrog fashion , ignoring small 20 - acre plots near the city centre in favour of vast planned towns further out . this drives land prices sharply down , especially the further you go from the centre . on top of that , an aversion to red tape makes it easy to get building permits . barton smith , a land economist at the university of houston , reckons lack of red tape is at least as important to keep costs low as lack of zoning laws . lack of zoning also makes neighbourhoods slightly more mixed in terms of usage ( residential and commercial are more muddled up than elsewhere ) and racially . because there are no zoning laws to force , say , a bankrupt restaurant to re - open as a restaurant , areas change shape quickly . at the same time , houston is less segregated racially than any other city , bymost measures . one should not be over - impressed by this . whites in houston may be more likely than their peers elsewhere to have had a conversation with someone of a different race in the previous week , but that hasn ' t stopped them heading for the suburbs . much of the racial mixture downtown is of blacks , latinos and asians ( the city has america ' s second - largest vietnamese settlement after southern california ) . but because zoning laws do not enable local groups to keep poor people out ( for example , by requiring that all housing plots be huge ) , houston remains racially desegregated by american standards . this helps draw in immigrant workers , creating a pool of labour . that leads to the third of houston ' s main characteristics which should prove an advantage in the 21 st century : racial tolerance . houston looked like a southern town until the 1970 s : white , with a large black minority . a generation later , its population is roughly one - third white , one - third black and ( slightly over ) one - third brown . other cities have similar profiles but none went from a bi - racial to amulti - racial city quite so abruptly . even more strikingly , it did so peacefully . houston has not had a race riot since 1914 . for the largest southern city to have gone through the civil - rights era and its aftermath without upheaval is a remarkable comment on its politics . minorities have long been fully or over - represented in the city council , county commissions and the texas state legislature . bob stein of rice university argues that , unlike other growing cities , houston is reinventing the tradition of a powerful group of civic - minded business leaders , the fate of whose companies is closely tied to that of the city . ken lay , enron ' s chairman , is an example . he has been the driving force behind the building of two sports stadiums , and has a pet project to boost child literacy . rumour has it that he may run for mayor . the effect of this sort of civic - minded activism showed up in the late 1990 s . at a time when america was busily abolishing affirmative - action programmes , houston went the other way : it had a new one approved in a city - wide referendum . for better or worse , this showed how racially tolerant it is . for how much longer ? in many ways , houston is thriving because it has kept alive an old - fashioned , industrial mode of growth , built on cheap land , low taxes , immigrant labour and unfettered pro - business policies . this model may not be enough in the next decades . houston is ugly . it was hardly charming to begin with and has pulled down many of its old buildings . it may have to pull down even more after recent floods caused $ 2 billion - worth of damage . it is also , as al gore rudely pointed out during the presidential campaign , polluted . since cities now have to attract skilled workers with quality of life benefits , this is a big problem , and not one that can be overcome by cheap housing . business leaders are frantically trying to catch up . in an unusual example of bipartisanship , a fervently conservative property developer has joined forces with a former member of the clinton administration to back a $ 500 m bond issue to plant lm trees . the greater houston partnership has executed an about - turn on pollution . having argued last year that new pollution controls damage growth , it is now on a crash course to cut ozone - creating emissions as fast as it can . if this sudden change of mind is real , it poses a tough question about zoning . houston has 2 , 300 people an acre , compared with 6 , 000 in los angeles and 20 , 000 in new york ( at the other end of the scale ) . this extraordinary extensiveness is expensive . at one point in the early 1990 s , houston alone was spending more on roads than any state except california ( and , of course , texas ) . there are doubts about how much further sprawl can go . three - quarters of the best - paid jobs are still on or within the inner ring road . some new suburbs are 50 miles away . can the city continue to burst outwards while attracting the skilled people whose jobs are downtown ? and surely that means introducing zoning ? lastly , houston faces a severe problem in the one area where its national reputation is high : education . to run his number - one priority , mr bush picked as secretary of education rod paige , a former head of the houston independent school district . the president claimed , correctly , that mr paige had overseen substantial improvements in the city ' s education , especially among minorities . what he did not say is that these improvements have been nothing like enough . despite successes in individual schools , half of all latinos fail to graduate from high school , compared with 10 % of whites and 20 % of blacks . whites are abandoning houston ' s public schools . they represent only 12 % of pupils ; 54 % are latino . more than a quarter of today ' s schoolchildren are likely to dropout . in a world where a good job depends on having a college degree , this is alarming . rice university ' s mr klineberg argues that new immigrants from mexico arrive lagging further behind the rest of the country educationally than did the wave of immigrants in the early 1900 s . the first wave took several generations to catch up . today ' s immigrants will have to close a bigger gap more quickly . if they do not , they may end up in an underclass that could scratch at houston ' sracial harmony . this is houston can houston make it ? the city has experienced the three big transformations that affect america in their purest form : the change from a raw - material economy to services ; the change from a bi - racial to a multi - racial place ; and the moderation of a no - holds - barred pro - business culture to take account of environmental and social costs . elsewhere , these changes have occurred over 50 years . houston has lived through them in 20 . and the next 20 years will probably be just as dramatic and successful . hold onto those stetsons . copyright ? ? 1995 -

managed to get smrazor working (milter) -- sort of ... With light server

occuring (I set the milter timeout per message to 15 seconds) often in huge

MACHINIMA  My reputation for small errors continues to grow (I am
keeping quiet about the big ones) with a misprint in last week's
piece on this word. In the sentence giving the etymology, of all
places, I misspelled it ""mechanima"", thus confusing everybody.APPETITE OVER TIN CUP  Several replies came in about this saying,
confirming that variations on it and other ways of saying ""head
over heels"" are widely known, especially ""ass over appetite"" from
the US, where ""appetite"" may be a transferred term for the mouth.
But the specific form that Maria Jessup Robinson was asking about,
""appetite over tin cup"", seems not to be known much at all. It
would seem to be a conflation of the British expression ""arse over
teakettle"" and the American ""ass over appetite"" (note my deliberate
use of the two spellings of ""arse"" here!). The saying was probably
modified because at the time it was created a tea kettle was an
item less common in America than in Britain. Even in Britain these
days it is obsolete as a fixed term except within this expression,
which itself is now not very common.BUMBERSHOOT  Several subscribers have pointed out that the word is
in the lyric of a song sung by Dick Van Dyke in the film ""Chitty
Chitty Bang Bang"":  Me ol' bam-boo, me ol' bam-boo
  You'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo
  You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
  But you'd better never bother with me ol' bam-booIt may be one reason why some Americans, not familiar with the word
in their own country, have come to believe it must be British.OLOGIES AND ISMS  The publication date of my book has been moved
back a week in the UK to 29 August. A review by Jonathon Green is
scheduled for the issue of 31 August (assuming nobody changes the
date again). See  for
more details and UK ordering information.
2. Turns of Phrase: Asian Brown Cloud
-------------------------------------------------------------------
As though we didn't have enough to worry about weather-wise, what
with global warming, the ozone hole, and the new El NiÃ±o season,
UN scientists have now identified this new threat to the world's
climate. It is a cloud of smog three kilometres deep, enveloping
the whole of southern Asia - a soup of industrial pollutants,
carbon monoxide from vehicle exhausts and particles of soot from
burning forests and millions of rural cooking fires. It blocks 15%
of sunlight, which reduces crop yields. It also creates acid rain,
leads to respiratory illnesses, reduces rainfall and causes extreme
weather events. Because the cloud is capable of being dispersed
rapidly around the world, it may affect a much wider area than just
Asia. The term ""Asian Brown Cloud"" seems to have been around for a
couple of years in scientific circles, but came to prominence this
week in a report prepared by a team of international climatologists
at the UN Environment Programme in preparation for the World Summit
on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg next week. The good
news, they say, is that unlike other causes of pollution and
climate change, this one is curable if Asians can shift to more
efficient ways of burning fuels.The ""Asian Brown Cloud,"" a 2-mile-thick blanket of pollution over
South Asia, may be causing the premature deaths of half a million
people in India each year, deadly flooding in some areas and
drought in others, a new U.N.-sponsored study indicates.
                                   [""Los Angeles Times"", Aug. 2002]A UN-backed study released on Friday said the ""Asian Brown Cloud"" -
a vast haze of pollution stretching across South Asia - is damaging
agriculture, modifying rainfall patterns and endangering the
population.

3. Weird Words: Pyknic  /'pIknIk/
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Short and fat.Nothing to do with al-fresco meals, though it is said the same way
as ""picnic"".In the early years of the twentieth century the German psychiatrist
Ernst Kretschmer examined criminals to try to tie their physical
shape and constitution to their personalities and mental illnesses.
Tall and thin ones he called ""asthenic"" (or ""leptosomic"") and
considered them to be the sort that commits fraud and petty theft.
A second set were athletic types with well-developed muscles, whom
he concluded, unsurprisingly, were more likely to be violent. The
third sort were the ""pyknic"" ones, who seemed to be a mixture of
the other two kinds so far as their criminal tendencies were
concerned. He took ""pyknic"" from Greek ""puknos"", thick or close-
packed; it appeared first in his book ""KÃ¶rperbau und Charakter""
(Physique and Character) in 1921, from where it soon moved into
English.The American psychologist William Sheldon built on and modified
Kretschmer's ideas, coming up with the three terms to describe body
types - ""endomorph"", ""mesomorph"" and ""ectomorph"" - that are now
more common. He considered Kretschmer's pyknic type to be a mixture
of the endomorph (with a soft round body tending to put on fat, the
Santa Claus type) and the mesomorph (with a compact, powerful, and
athletic body tending to the Tarzan or Mr Universe type) and came
up with the phrase ""pyknic practical joke"" to describe a person who
is muscular in early life but who later goes pear-shaped and
balloons out into obesity.
4. Q&A
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. A friend and I were reading a recent article in the ""New York
Times"" that made mention of a ""mash note"". I had never heard this
term before, but I extrapolated that it is some sort of love note.
Is there a more specific meaning than a simple love note? And can
you give some insight as to the origin of the term? [Jane
Rosenthal, California]A. You're right about the meaning of the phrase.We have to go back some way to find the origin. The first form was
the word ""mash"" by itself. This was a slang term in the US in the
1870s for an infatuation or crush (a magazine in 1877 defined it as
""a deep but fleeting affection of the heart""). A ""mash"" could also
be a dandy or the object of one's affection (of either sex) or - as
a verb - to make amorous advances to a member of the opposite sex,
to flirt or seduce. A ""masher"" was a man who thought himself
irresistible to the female sex but whose advances were often
unwelcome.The evidence collected by Professor Lighter in the ""Random House
Historical Dictionary of American Slang"" and by others suggests
that it was originally a term used in and around the theatre.
Charles Godfrey Leland (best known for his ""Hans BreitmannÂ’s
Ballads"" about a German immigrant) wrote a note above his poem,
""The Masher"", dated about 1895, confirming this:  The word to ""mash,"" in the sense of causing love or
  attracting by a glance or fascinating look, came into
  ordinary slang from the American stage. Thus an actress
  was often fined for ""mashing"" or smiling at men in the
  audience.""Mash"" and its derivatives crossed the Atlantic to Britain about
1880. ""Masher"" in particular became a term in London society,
especially among the more raffish supper-club and theatre-going
classes, for a type of fashionable male. The Oxford English
Dictionary defines it (with a distinctly maidenly air of drawing
away its collective skirts) as ""a fop of affected manners and
exaggerated style of dress who frequented music-halls and
fashionable promenades and who posed as a 'lady-killer'"", noting
that the word had been common ""in 1882 and for a few years after"".
In a letter from London in the old ""Overland Monthly and Out West
Magazine"" in 1889, a correspondent described a member of an
impoverished theatrical company: ""This dashing youth was distinctly
conscious of his fascinations for the buxom maids who sighed beside
us, and the airy and elegant nonchalance of the glances that
superbly took them in would be a lesson for champion 'mashers' of a
far higher class"".A ""mash note"" (in its first appearances, ""mash letter"") was an
obvious enough extension: a love letter. It is recorded first in
1880 and - as you have discovered - is still doing well.Where ""mash"" and its relatives come from has been a subject of
debate. It is sometimes said that it is from the standard English
word meaning to make soft by one of various means, with its obvious
reference to rendering the object of one's attentions pliable and
yielding. Max Beerbohm, writing in London in 1894 (mashers were
still around then, despite the OED's comment) remarked that some
people derived it from ""Ma ChÃ¨re"", ""the mode of address used by the
gilded youth to the barmaids of the period"". But he thought it
really came from ""the chorus of a song, which, at that time, had a
great vogue in the music-halls: 'I'm the slashing, dashing, mashing
Montmorency of the day.'"" We're pretty sure now that he was wrong,
but he could hardly know that.Back to Charles Leland again. Apart from his humorous writings, he
also researched and wrote a great deal about the Romany language as
well as Gypsy songs and customs. The following note from the
introduction to the poem gives an origin that is now widely
accepted:  It was introduced by the well-known gypsy family of actors,
  C., among whom Romany was habitually spoken. The word
  ""masher"" or ""mash"" means in that tongue to allure, delude,
  or entice. It was doubtless much aided in its popularity by
  its quasi-identity with the English word. But there can be
  no doubt as to the gypsy origin of ""mash"" as used on the
  stage. I am indebted for this information to the late well-
  known impresario Palmer of New York, and I made a note of
  it years before the term had become at all popular.Though defunct in British English, ""mash"" and ""masher"" have never
quite gone away in America. ""Mash"" had a resurgence of popularity
as student slang in the 1980s in the sense of necking or petting,
though that may be a back-formation from ""mash note"".

""A Spanish lady asked an acquaintance during a visit to Ireland
whether there was a word in his language similar to 'manaÃ±a'. The
Irishman thought for a moment, then said: 'Sure there is, but it
doesn't have the same sense of urgency.'"" [Traditional Irish joke.]

831,"sum : quantification about four weeks ago , in linguist 8 . 948 , i asked a question on behalf of the basque language academy 's grammar commission about the standard or recommended scope of "" quantifier "" and "" quantification "" as grammatical terms , with special reference to the function of "" so many "" and "" so "" in sentences like : there were so many students that we needed a larger classroom . the students were so intelligent that we needed to get another teacher . i wished to know whether it is considered terminologically appropriate to say that not only "" many "" and "" so many "" but also "" very "" and "" so "" quantify , and thus that the function of all of these ( including what i call degree modifiers ) is quantification . better to contextualize the terminological problem that motivated the question in the first place and to help clarify the following report / discussion , let me suggest , ad hoc , calling the two positions contemplated the "" quantifiers versus degree modifiers "" position and the "" quantifiers subsuming degree modifiers "" position respectively ; or for short , the versus position and the subsuming position . it is also only honest for me to declare at this point that my personal position has always been and continues to be that of the versus view , although i tried to word the original question neutrally . at this point i perhaps ought to note that several respondents seem to prefer to treat "" so many ( students ) "" and "" so ( intelligent ) "" as merely various occurrences of a single item "" so "" rather than treating _ so many _ as an "" item "" to be discussed in its own right . i view this as a manifestation of linguistic anglocentrism : unlike english , in many languages "" so many "" is not expressed by the item equivalent to english "" so "" plus a quantifier equivalent to english "" many "" , and since i was not particularly asking about english in my question , i reject the assumption that the english lexical composition of "" so many "" is of crucial relevance to the issue i raised . thanks to the following who responded to my question : bruce d . despain , patricia galea , e . h . klein - v . d . laaken , jan k . lindstrom , p . l . peterson and marilyn n . silva . a summary of their answers and suggestions follows , with an interjection of my own personal opinion at times , identified by my initials ark . marilyn silva supports the versus position , stating that "" quantifiers determine noun phrases , not adjectives . "" for "" very "" and "" so "" she prefers the term "" intensifier "" to my proposed "" degree modifier "" . patricia galea expresses the same views . ( [ ark : ] since my original question was not about the latter terms , i shall refrain from defending my preference of "" degree modifier "" over "" intensifier "" in this context ; larry trask 's _ dictionary of grammatical terms in linguistics _ treats the two terms as interchangeble . ) marilyn silva also discussed what i called "" consecutive "" sentences , pointing out that the subordinate clauses in the two english examples cited above , "" . . . that we needed a larger classroom "" and "" . . . that we needed to get another teacher "" , are called "" adverbial clauses of extent "" in her treatment of english grammar , _ grammar in many voices _ ( ntc pub . group , 1995 ) . she considers that here "" it is the clause that seems to quantify , not the intensifier in the main clause "" . silva went on to point out that english clauses of extent can be licensed by a main clause containing _ so _ ( with or without _ many _ ) , as above , but also by one containing _ such _ , as in : george was such a gentleman that he never raised his voice . and draws our attention to the fact that _ such _ could hardly be called a quantifier . ( [ ark : ] this argument seems to be of general typological interest , independently of the fact that there is no real equivalent of this use of _ such _ in basque . ) in all these sentences with extent clauses , silva argues , "" it is the [ subordinate ] clause that seems to quantify , not the intensifier in the main clause . . . which merely licenses the subordinate clause . "" according to silva , then , _ so _ and _ such _ should not be lumped together with items like _ many _ or _ very _ in any case , in line with the view that they do not themselves quantify but merely license a subordinate clause which quantifies . looking beyond english , jan lindstrom pointed out that in swedish a single lexical item , _ mycket _ , functions both as a quantifier ( of nouns ) meaning "" much "" and as a degree modifier or intensifier of adjectives meaning "" very "" , providing the following examples : 1 ) da "" r fanns mycket folk . ' there was much people ' 2 ) hon a "" r mycket intelligent . ' she is very intelligent ' lindstrom does not seem to be defending a particular terminological usage in providing this observation , but merely wishes to offer useful information that may be of interest in the discussion . [ ark : ] it seems to me that while the interest of this sort of observation is undeniable , it does not obviate the need for a terminological distinction , nor does it justify the subsumes position , but rather illustrates the need for linguists to employ a clear meta-language to enable us to distinguish between items or uses even where , as here , their formal expressions overlap language-specifically . ( by the way , some other instances of the use of a single form for "" very "" and "" much "" include portuguese _ muito _ , catalan _ molt _ , and italian _ molto _ ; but i can think of many more languages that do not show this kind of overlap or homonymy . ) philip peterson wrote discussing in somewhat more abstract terms the actual semantics of terms like "" many "" and "" more "" , and referred me to his article "" complexly fractionated syllogistic quantifiers "" ( journal of philosophical logic , 1991 , 20 , 287-313 ) . bruce despain 's comments are oriented to language-specific issues of syntactic classification of quantifiers in english that are not likely to be relevant to a description of basque , for which reason i shall not report his suggestions here . henny klein brought to my attention the following bibliographical reference : gary , e . ( 1979 ) extent in english . a unified account of degree and quantity . phd thesis , university of california , los angeles . in summary , none of those who responded favoured the subsuming position according to which "" very "" and "" so "" can be referred to as quantifiers or their function as quantification ( unless that was what jan lindstrom wished to imply ; it is my understanding that it was not ) . four of the six answers do not actually lean one way or the other . the two answers that address my question directly and suggest an answer , those of silva and galea , both constitute votes for the versus position . eskerrik asko denoi ( many thanks to all ) alan r . king , ph . d . alanking @ bigfoot . com alternative email addresses : mccay @ redestb . es , a @ eirelink . com , 70244 . 1674 @ compuserve . com snail : orkolaga plaza 3 1a , 20800 zarautz , basque country , spain phone : + 34-43 - 134125 / fax : + 34-43 - 130396 visit my web page at - - > http : / / www . eirelink . com / alanking /",0

I'm looking to build a completely silent pc. It's gonna be a gateway for
a wireless network and will sit in my room (as my room is only
spitting distance from the chimney where i'll be mounting the aerial) 
It has to be completely silent, or it'll do my nut. What do I need? I'll prob use a shitty p166 i have here, it doesnt have a fan, and I'm not
worried about HD noise too much as it'll be idle mostly (should I be?) 
any info would be appreciated. I can't afford one of those lovely new
shoebox size totally silent pcs and I cant use an old laptop as I have a
pci wireless card and cable already bought (160$ or so)And where can I get a fanless psu? I know they exist because the lads
at antefacto had them (lads, where can I get one?). Although I do remember
a slight lack of metal box around the humongous voltage parts!

What does that exactly have to do with the statement that
distruption of peacable political assembly has become
a common practice disruption tool?  It's an observation
not a judgement, comment, approval.  You've focused on the
word ""muddy"" to use it in a different context than the one
I posted.Maybe the distinction I was trying to make was too subtle and
I was trying to be too clever with my writing this morning.
Let me summarize the important parts of my post for you: I
have a premise that there is a difference between free and protected
speech and action.  I think O'Neill on his soapbox doesn't
understand the distinction.All better?  Greg

Bomber targets Dutch Ikea storesPolice in the Netherlands are searching all 10 outlets of the Ikea furniture
chain in the country, after finding bombs in two stores.
The devices were discovered in Amsterdam and Sliedrecht, near the port city
of Rotterdam on Tuesday evening.
The Sliedrecht bomb exploded at a police station, injuring two policeman.
Police have also closed off a motorway section in the central city Utrecht,
near a third IKEA store where a suspicious package was found.
No information about the motive behind the attacks has been released.
""We decided together with the police because of safety reasons that the
company's stores in the Netherlands would be closed today,"" said Ikea
spokeswoman Helen van Trearum.
""We don't want to take any risks. We are taking this very seriously,"" she
added.
Ikea - a Swedish-based group - is one of the world's largest furniture
retailers, with stores in more than 30 countries.
Meanwhile, the Amsterdam head office of the Dutch news agency ANP was
evacuated on Wednesday, after police warned that a bomb might have been
planted in the building.To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:

"" deutsche banc alex . brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth - quarter projections for natural - gas prices last week . "" prior to sept . 11 , we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back , "" said jay saunders , a deutsche banc analyst . "" but all that is out the window now . "" deutsche banc is now estimating a 20 % drop in winter demand in the industrial sector , which accounts for more than a quarter of total u . s . natural - gas consumption . the slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage , which is on pace to be full by the end of october . while prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers , such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural - gas demand is met . lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms , such as eog resources inc . , plan to moderate production in the next two months . gas drilling - rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1 , 030 at the end of august . even with the increased natural - gas drilling of earlier this year , overall natural - gas supply is expected to increase just 1 % this year , as the country ' s mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them . the tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates , increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence . still , the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form . with prices high last winter , el paso corp . and enron corp . , among others , said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas , which is gas compressed and frozen to minus - 260 degrees fahrenheit . "" you will see some cancellations and some delays , "" predicts marshall adkins , an analyst with raymond james & associates in houston . natural - gas prices need to average $ 3 per million btus on the east coast and $ 3 . 50 on the west coast to justify bringing in lng to those areas , said ronald barone , an analyst with ubs warburg . a spokeswoman for el paso , houston , says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the u . s . market . enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the bahamas that would pipe the gas to florida starting in 2004 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron leases part of mumbai estate to citibank freny patel mumbai 10 / 02 / 2001 business standard 5 copyright ( c ) business standard after months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at wockhardt towers in bandra - kurla complex , enron has been able lease out 10 , 000 square feet of it to citibank na . against an expected realisation from rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors , enron will get around rs 1 . 2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to citibank . the deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant , cushman & wakefield , at a monthly rental of rs 100 per square foot . with property prices in mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the short run , companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets . property consultants say that if enron manages to lease out the entire four floors , it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer , as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income . enron had eyed a deal of rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around rs 12 , 000 per square foot . this is despite the fact that real estate at bandra kurla currently fetches rs 8 , 000 to rs 9 , 000 per square feet . in june 2000 , the us energy giant had shelled out rs 125 . 75 crore when it acquired the four floors , plus car park space , from wockhardt , the pharmaceutical company . the deal was struck at rs 10 , 500 per sq ft , and included parking space for 101 cars . industry sources said that enron had spent a sum close to rs 150 crore to acquire the property , and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired . in order for it to break even , it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of rs 13 , 000 per square foot . four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by enron for the sale of its premises . a leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property . "" most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase , "" he added . moreover , the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built - up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises , and enron ' s proposition continues to go abegging , said the consultant . copyright ? 2000 dow jones ranking includes 14 newcomers though hewlett - packard lost $ 65 billion in market value in a year , ceo carly fiorina hasn ' t lost her nerve , and for the fourth consecutive year holds the no . 1 position on fortune ' s ranking of the 50 most powerful women in business . the complete list and accompanying stories are in the october 15 issue of fortune , available on newsstands october 8 and at www . fortune . com at 12 : 00 p . m . on october 1 . in the no . 2 spot is ebay ceo meg whitman , who runs an internet company that actually makes money : $ 85 million in the last four quarters on $ 582 million in revenue . oprah winfrey , the queen of media , is mightier than ever , and holds the no . 3 spot , up from no . 15 last year . she produces movies , brings comfort and advice to millions of tv viewers , propels books to bestsellerdom , and , last year , teamed up with hearst magazines ' cathie black ( no . 28 on the list ) to publish o , the oprah magazine - by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever . at no . 4 is andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon , who has breathed life into ailing avon . mirant ceo marce fuller - the only newcomer in the top five - holds the no . 5 position . inside a stodgy utility , southern , fuller built a high - growth trading and marketing unit , which was spun off in april . in these new , more tempered times , patience may be about to reap its reward . in fortune ' s annual survey of the 50 most powerful women in business , there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly . says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in "" patient but not passive , "" the story that accompanies the list , "" by patience , we mean staying with a company , steadily building influence there , and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge , not promises and self - promotion . "" fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , "" people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , "" she says . as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah "" hurricane debby "" hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at the startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter . fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; janet davidson , group president , integrated network solutions , lucent ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon . while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : "" we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . "" the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first . in a related story , "" it took a lady to save avon , "" katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , "" jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . "" over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins . in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou -

890,">See Jared Diamond's excellent ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" for the story.Yeah, I know the party line.  The evidence for it is extremely meagre.
New Worlders had two entire continents and tens of millions of people,
which is a plenty big enough reservoir for infectious diseases to thrive
in.  Their records show that they were plagued with them long before 1492.Take Ireland in the early 1800s.  Assume a population of circa 8
million.  Take Ireland around 1900.  Assume a population not much
above 3 million.  Ignore natural variations between mortality and
natality.  Omit emigration.  Observe the Great Famine in the middle.
Deduce that it killed 5 million (actually about 1).  Transpose to 16th
century Mexico.  Grossly inflate estimates of pre-contact population,
because nobody has a damn clue what it was anyway.  Underestimate
later population levels.  Deduce that 10's of millions died.  Lather,
rinse, repeat.R

five years later, mainly to get around not being able to do
cross-device hard linking, as I understand it. Soft links are fairly
classic Berkeley hackery (cf. gethostbyname, h_errno, and the
resultant problems implementing mt-safe interfaces); they do what they
were intended for, but break fairly easily, in this case when the

10346,"Hi all,I've decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result is
that I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually
testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality
people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from
that, right? ;-)I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages
should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and
maybe others, who knows ;-)Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :
- Recompile the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm for your running kernel
  (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10)
- Install this ""alsa-driver"" package
- Install the ""alsa-libs"" package
- Install the ""alsa-utils"" packageNow go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your
/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :
http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/
(very complete and very good documentation!)
Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need
to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) ""by hand"" and
insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! (""dmesg"" to
check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with
e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.With ""aplay"" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You
can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...
hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3
files... that's it!It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only
thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't
imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the
/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly
%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d
structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the
default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's
development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static
libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against
which the ""alsa-driver"" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the
rpm release, so does the architecture!).I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!Download :
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/Current spec files :
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec
(All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )MatthiasPS: As an extra bonus, I've also recompiled xine with alsa support! Simply
run ""xine -A alsa09"" and off you go! It may even support 5.1 and S/PDIF ;-)--

I see that Robert S. Wojciechowski Jr. posted about this issue on 7/26,
but I don't see any responses. I get that error when calling razor-report
from a sendmail alias, but not from the command line as a different user.
The way I solved it was to run razor-admin -createandrazor-admin -discoverwith a -home argument set to the global /etc/razor directory, which is
explicitly specified in the args to the alias pipe.The manual page, which suggests that /etc/razor/razor-agent.conf will be
loaded first, does not also say that razor-admin will then create a
.razor directory in the user's home directory if it does not exist
(although this /is/ pointed out in the razor-agents(1) page. This may
lead to some minor confusion if the user is trying to set the discovery
and other defaults for a default (e.g., /etc/razor) install. The
workaround is as I say above, namely, explicitly specify the path to
razorhome on the command line, e.g.razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -create
razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -discoverhth,

9790,"the evaluation of parsing systems the evaluation of parsing systems a workshop jointly organised by the cec language engineering 1 projects sparkle and ecran to be held at the first international conference on language resources and evaluation granada , spain , 26 may 1998 this workshop will provide a forum for researchers interested in the development and evaluation of natural language grammars and parsing systems , and in the creation of syntactically annotated reference corpora . organisers : john carroll , roberto basili , nicoletta calzolari , robert gaizauskas , gregory grefenstette workshop scope and aims the aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussion of evaluation methods for parsing systems , and proposals for the development of syntactically annotated language resources . with increased attention to evaluation of component technology in language engineering , evaluation of parsing systems is rapidly becoming a key issue . numerous methods have been proposed and while one , the parseval / penn treebank scheme , has gained wide usage , this has to some extent been due to the absence of workable alternatives rather than to whole-hearted support . parseval / ptb evaluation has several limitations and drawbacks , including a commitment to a particular style of grammatical analysis , and oversensitivity to certain innocuous types of misanalysis while failing to penalise other common types of more serious mistake . also , the original published description of the scheme - - and the evaluation software widely distributed as a follow-up to it - - is specific to the english language . it may be that there are currently no alternative more workable schemes or proposals , but this needs to be more fully discussed : this workshop will provide an opportunity for such a debate . this workshop is particularly timely given the large number of cec language engineering projects that involve parsing in one form or another and which need to evaluate and share the results of their efforts . parsing is an essential part of many larger applications , such as information extraction , which have gained in importance over the last few years . often in such systems , the strength of the parser and grammar has a direct effect on the desired results , and thus achieving good results rests on being able to determine and improve weaknesses in the parser / grammar . without a reliable parser evaluation method this cannot be done effectively . a parsing evaluation workshop is also appropriate at this time given the imminent creation of large-scale syntactically annotated resources for european languages . contributions from those involved in such activities are welcomed , so as to improve communication between the resource construction and the resource utilisation communities . this should ensure that the resources constructed are maximally useful to the general language engineering community . the organisation of this workshop brings together two european language engineering projects which are closely related and whose partners share similar research interests : sparkle and ecran . the organisers solicit contributions from the general community on the following topics : - descriptions of generic syntactic annotation schemes - methodologies and metrics for parsing system evaluation - reports and analyses of the results of utilising particular parser evaluation schemes -

"" i think the cfo should be out of there right now . in the interest of the stockholders , that cfo should be gone , "" he said . enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements , but fastow severed his ties with the ljm 2 partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities . poor judgment ? analysts said that at the very least , the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at enron , which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of high - profile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer jeff skilling in august .

"" it points to poor decision - making on behalf of the board and top management at enron , "" he said . enron , north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity , was one of wall street ' s high flyers last year , when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent . the stock ' s ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company ' s plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its enrononline internet energy trading platform . this year enron ' s shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadband and the internet soured , skilling resigned after only six months as ceo , and the company ' s dabhol power plant project in india became mired in a payments dispute . moody ' s investors service said earlier this week that it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after enron took $ 1 . 01 billion in write - downs and charges that substantially reduced valuations for several non - core businesses , including broadband and water services . some of enron ' s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings . analysts said enron ' s credibility has been severely damaged and the recent reports about the ljm 2 partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant surprises may lie ahead . "" what don ' t we know that went on at that company ? where ' s the credibility ? "" asked one frustrated analyst .

"" good people can always be placed . as long as there is a job to fill and the company has a budget to hire , "" sarah gilley of london - based recruitment group exchange consulting said . "" where the situation starts to get difficult is where everyone is cutting budgets , people are not being replaced when they leave and there have been an awful lot of redundancies . "" last week , scotiamocatta , a subsidiary of the bank of nova scotia and a key ring dealing member , unveiled its decision to give up open outcry trading on the lme floor , prompting around 25 job losses among traders , phone jockeys and clerks . then blue - blooded banker n . m . rothschild & sons closed its london and new york base metals units . it left its core precious metals business intact , but 20 base metals staff were laid off in the process . in the same week , the lme ' s largest floor trader , enron metals , said it planned to cut 10 to 20 percent of its metals staff as part of an exercise to cut 250 to 500 jobs in the enron group . security with three big market players and several major banks with commodities divisions slashing jobs at the same time , competition in the labour market will intensify and those in work are becoming wary about job security . "" what we ' re finding at the moment is that there is still demand for traders with a track record , which is possibly increasing because people are nervous about their jobs and so they ' re keen to stay put , "" gilley said . "" so whereas someone who might be a big money - spinner with a track record would have previously stayed in their job for two to three years , they are now staying for three to five years . "" they probably feel that they ' re reasonably safe where they are , they ' re well recognised and not going to stick their necks out , "" she said . bonus fears october has never traditionally been a strong month for the the jobs market in base metals as players are often distracted by lme week functions and conferences also , traders tend to be looking towards their annual performance - linked bonuses , which are usually announced at the end of the year . "" those who are in work at the moment are sticking . often at this time of year , people are hanging on for their bonuses . but i don ' t think any of them are anticipating good bonuses . they ' re probably just happy to have a job , "" sian griffiths of exchange consulting said . lme volumes traded have been fallen over the past 18 months as the powerful hedge funds that once took a shine to the metals swarmed into areas such as hi - tech and telecomms stocks . metals traders who handled the large volume of fund activity have begun to focus again on moree traditional clients , and this may yet prove a boon for the jobs market . companies are seeking to fill a shortage of staff schooled in the traditional practices of trading physical metal . "" a lot of companies who had sidelined the traditional physical business are now re - aligning their focus and need poeple who understand the physical market and know how to set up a hedge and manage it , "" gilley said . "" the other area where demand has markedly increased in comparison to a few years ago is marketing , "" she added . as for morale in the industry , individuals ' confidence in their future is seemingly undimmed .

5. SITE STATISTICS
0. INTROHello SourceForge.net Users,This week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any
large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to
the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you.
These databases manage everything from user authentication, session
management, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database-
dependent website.Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2,
a powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because
the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and
70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this
growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us
the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the
press release here:http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.htmlHow will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much
difference other then the site will continue to grow and the
SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later
phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of
the databases advanced capabilities.Today our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the
site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months.If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site,
please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always
appreciate the feedback.Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the
Open Source Community.Pat-Patrick McGovern
Director, SourceForge.net1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITYSourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth
is never-ending.  Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to
ensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source
community can always obtain the software released by hosted
projects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity
download servers.  These servers are located throughout the world,
as to provide better download times regardless of which network
provider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location.Three new download servers have recently been added to our network,
further strengthening our file serving capabilities.  These latest
additions include servers hosted by:Time Warner Telecom (Wisconsin,USA);

replies that look like this:  ""Hey!! I didn't subscribe to this list!!!
You spammer. I hate you!  I hate your dog!  (insert other colorful
phrases here)"".  The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net
there was a check box that said ""Receive Site-wide updates, low
volume"".  You left it checked when you submitted the registration form,
hence you are receiving this email.  We send these updates every 4 to 6
weeks, so it truly is low volume.  However if you want off, this is not
a problem.  Simply click on the link below.

as mine). There's no dependancies on libstdc++ other than binary ones.Currently on release dwd2, which I'm using on my home rawhide box.
(Obviously not production, since the old apt works fine on production
boxes).Now... Does anyone know of a good way to delete ""old"" RPMS from a
directory containing both ""new"" and ""old"" RPMS? Say I have
blurb-0.1.0-1.i386.rpm, blurb-0.1.0-2.i386.rpm, and
blurb-0.1.1-1.i386.rpm, and want to remove the blurb-0.1.0-* because of
the presence of blurb-0.1.1-1? Anyone have a convenient script?Dave.

963,"el paso articles today - ngi note : the following 3 articles deal with 3 different issues : lst - - marketing related 2 nd - operations / marketing related 3 rd - legislative / regulatory related el paso explosion takes 500 mmcf / d off market about 1 bcf / d of flow on el paso ' s south mainline downstream of pecos river ( nm ) station ceased after the pipeline exploded early saturday , killing 10 people and seriously injuring two others at a nearby campsite . el paso said monday it was able to compensate for about half that volume through a combination of fuel switching by downstream customers , maximum storage withdrawals , an ofo and other customer cooperation . the market reaction was rather predictable as all three california points rose by about 35 cents to lead an overall price surge . however , utilities in the state did not appear to be experiencing any supply problems . socal gas said storage and supplies from other southwest receipt points were adequate to avoid any problems . a gas operations official for los angeles dept . of water and power also saw no reason for panic . from past similar incidents on southwest pipelines , he expected that the approximately 80 - feet - long section missing from el paso ' s line could be "" slapped back into place rather quickly . "" el paso itself had no estimate for when it can restore service in the impacted segment ; it must get approval rom the federal investigators before beginning repairs or evaluating a restart of the adjacent lines . but a large aggregator and a marketer agreed with the ladwp official that it should be "" a quick mechanical fix "" once repairs begin . the aggregator believed downtime could be as short as a week . no customers were cut off as a result of the rupture but some were getting reduced volumes , an el paso spokeswoman said . northern natural gas was seeing a throughput increase of 200 - 300 mmcf / d monday while transwestern volumes were up 50 - 75 mmcf / d as a result of shippers diverting gas away from el paso ' s south mainline , an enron spokeswoman said . a producer said she diverted as much of her company ' s gas as possible from el paso to transwestern . people were reluctant to trade permian basin gas monday , especially at fixed prices , because of doubts about how much would be able to flow , several sources said . permian numbers rose a little less than 18 cents as part of the general upturn . however , it was waha prices that saw a bigger increase of nearly 30 cents as a result . "" everything in el paso - permian ' s keystone pool was going back into waha , "" said a marketer , putting waha in the mid $ 4 . 60 s at a premium of more than a nickel above henry hub . the southern california border , at an average of nearly $ 5 . 30 , led the rest of monday ' s market by a large margin . before trading began , enrononline was offering border swing swaps for the rest of the month at $ 5 . 85 - 95 , a marketer said . with swing swaps priced so high , it gave sellers more confidence in what prices they could command in the day market , he said . "" either way , i wouldn ' t want to be short right now at the border . "" there were lots of rumors but no facts available on what caused the el paso rupture , noted one aggregator . "" but it ' s a good thing it didn ' t happen until after california had cooled off . otherwise i could easily have seen the border basis spread from san juan basin go as high as $ 2 . 50 "" instead of the approximate gap of $ 1 . 70 egistered monday by daily gpi . a knowledgeable source provided his analyis of the blast : the structure of the crater made the rupture "" look like a line integrity problem from the way it blew out . "" the earth can harbor leaking gas for a while until eventually everything all goes up at once . people nearby would not have detected anything because gas is odorless in long - haul lines ; the mercaptan odorant is not added until it gets to the local distribution stage . pipeline safety surveyors usually will look for dead vegetation in the vicinity to detect a leak , but this was a desert area with very little vegetation . it is easily possible for escaping gas to hug the ground for the approximate 500 - foot distance to the victims ' campsite and seek an ignition source there . it is a normal tendency for gas leaking into the atmosphere to stay close to the ground , and that tendency would have been amplied by the chilliness of the pre - dawn desert . the source went on to say , "" i think there will be lot more of this [ ruptures ] in the future with many pipes becoming at least 40 - 50 years old . "" el paso was unlucky in experiencing one of the early incidents , he said , because the situation applies to the other lines with old pipe . pipelines used to spend a lot more money on maintenance when regulation was tighter and they were still paying for depreciation , he said . "" now they ' re more purely for - profit companies after having written off their [ depreciation ] costs many times over . "" el paso blast kills 10 ; shuts down south mainline federal and company investigators monday swarmed over the scene of the devastating el paso natural gas mainline explosion that erupted near daybreak saturday , engulfing a party of weekend campers along the pecos river near carlsbad , nm , and killing 10 people . two other persons were hospitalized in critical condition . three officials from the federal office of pipeline safety ( ops ) and 11 with the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) have been at the site of the blast since late saturday , and two more ops officials were en route monday . new mexico gov . gary johnson , who flew to the area on sunday , said he wanted to know how many other potential pipeline "" dangers "" there are in the state . he called for a thorough investigation . about 1 bcf / d of capacity on el paso ' s southern leg initially was lost from the ruptured 30 - inch line and two looped lines nearby that were shut in after the accident . el paso was making up some of the shortfall by drawing the maximum , 200 mmcf / d from its washington ranch storage field downstream of the accident . increased use of other pipelines , allocations and cutbacks by customers , and the fact that weather had moderated in california helped ease the supply situation . nevertheless , spot prices increased by about 35 cents for points in california , while the rest of the market ( spurred by hurricane debby ) went up about 20 cents . there was no estimate as to when the looped lines would be back in service , according to el paso spokesperson kim wallace . "" we don ' t intend to put anything back into service until we know for certain that the remaining pipelines are safe , "" wallace said . she did not expect them to be back in service today , and could give no time frame on when they would be returned to service . it is "" much too premature at this point "" to predict when the three disabled el paso westbound lines will return to service , said patricia klinger , a spokeswoman with the department of transportation ' s research and special programs administration ( rspa ) , which oversees the ops . "" the one that ruptured is definitely going to be out of service for awhile , and [ another line ] is badly damaged from the fire . "" as for a third adjacent line , that "" could potentially be re - opened , "" but "" we have to test the integrity of that line "" and have it examined by metallurgists , she told daily gpi . "" everyone will be working , of course , to try to get this [ line ] back in service . but the safe operation of the pipeline is of premiere importance . "" the three lines shared the same right - of - way . "" we ' re just now able to start looking at exactly what happened , and how to get that one line back in service , "" klinger said . "" our metallurgist is on his way right now . i know he ' s going to meet with the ntsb when they ' re examining the 50 - foot section of pipe that ' s out of the ground "" as a result of the explosion . "" i think the company also wants to decide what types of tests can be done on this line . it ' s not piggable .

"" probably at this point we ' re looking at nine months to a year , maybe more "" before the results of the investigation are publicly disclosed , holloway noted . the rupture occurred at 5 : 30 a . m . mdt in the underground line near the pecos river crossing , which is about 30 miles south of the carlsbad caverns national park in a spot popular with local campers and fishermen . the blast tore a crater in the earth about 86 feet long , 46 feet wide and 20 feet deep . according to preliminary reports , the pipeline was underground at the point of rupture , sending two sections of pipe , each about 20 - feet long , flying hundreds of feet . the gas then ignited and shot flames from the broken pipe toward sleeping campers . the ntsb estimated there was a gap of 50 to 60 feet between broken ends of the pipeline at the site . the fire burned for about 40 minutes before el paso workers manually shut off pipeline valves . ten members of two families were burned to death in the blast . the families , who were related by marriage , were camping on public land along the river near where the pipeline emerged from the ground to cross the pecos in an aerial crossing alongside a bridge . six were pronounced dead at the scene and four others died at texas hospitals saturday night . the dead included five children under the age of six , including six - month - old twins . two adults were listed in critical condition monday at a hospital in lubbock , tx . the ruptured pipeline , which el paso said was constructed in 1950 , is one of four that runs along the southern branch of el paso ' s pipeline system . there is an adjacent 30 - inch pipeline and another 26 - inch pipeline . the fourth , a 16 - inch pipeline , was abandoned and is not available for service , wallace said . el paso and federal officials are particularly interested in the integrity of the second 30 - inch pipeline that ran close to the broken line . wallace said that none of the company ' s customers had been cut off of service , but they were receiving gas as reduced levels . she also said that on aug . 2 , a "" patrol "" inspection , either done by air or vehicle , was conducted on the pipelines located near the pecos river by el paso officials and no problems were found . el paso conducted the last corrosion test in february and no problems were found then either . visual inspections are conducted on all of the system ' s pipelines once a month , she said , and the company follows all federal pipeline requirements for inspections . asked whether el paso planned to change its inspection system immediately , wallace said that she did not think so , but said that if the ntsb review finds something that needs to be changed , the company will do whatever needs to be done immediately . "" these situations are so rare , "" she said . "" we don ' t feel that we need to change what we ' re doing now . but if the situation warrants , we certainly will make any changes necessary . "" el paso is working with family members to take care of their immediate needs , including hotel accommodations , food , travel arrangements and medical treatment . the company also is providing additional services as needed . "" this is a tragic accident and our heartfelt condolences go out to the families involved , "" said el paso energy president william wise . he said the company was working with the ntsb "" to investigate diligently all matters surrounding this accident and to establish its cause as quickly as possible . "" the fallout of the explosion is expected to extend all across the country , as federal legislators consider more stringent pipeline rules following an explosion in bellingham , wa , that killed three in june 1999 . locally , carlsbad mayor gary perkowski said that he wanted to find out what happened and keep it from ever happening again . that reaction was echoed by the new mexico governor .

diary.codemonkey.org.uk [Dave Jones]:
 Got a mail from Neil telling me about some whizzy new warnings in the cvs 
version of gcc. Pulled it and spent a while playing with gcc, and after a 
few false starts got it to spit out a bunch of warnings when compiling the 
kernel. There's a boatload of stuff that still needs cleaning up for 2.5 
(Things like __FUNCTION__ abuse and the like). 2.4 doesn't even compile due 
to broken asm constraints and other such sillies. As 3.x isn't a recommended 
compiler for 2.4, this isn't too important just yet. As more and more archs 
start using 3.x for their standard compiler though, we should clean up some 
of this stuff for 2.5. The new warning Neil tipped me off about 
(-Wunused-macros) turns out far too much crap. From what I looked at, 
it was correct in most cases, and yes there were macros being defined 
but being unused. Cleaning them up however creates a maintenance nightmare 
for anyone with patches in those areas already. (This sort of cleanup 
particularly hurts people like myself who have huge patches touching large 
parts of the tree). The recent gcc->c99 struct initialisers patch for instance 
made large parts of my tree reject. With more to come, the fun isn't over yet either.that is the CVS version, but it seems that more breakage is to come with the
kernel :((Everyone will want to compile their machine on the latest greatest... I think
they eventually persuaded Compaq's compiler to compile the kernel)...L.

so outright, this model actually approximates the cliche

huffed and puffed with the words ""perfectly obvious"" and ""exactly, 
precisely identical""? If your concern was with the ""typical"", why didn't you adopt the 
typical definition of ""promiscuous"", rather than a straw-man
definition which allowed you to interject ""DUH!!"" and mock an

itself sloppy and erroneous, then others may get a kick out of

13341,"puc press release announcing deal with edison puc and edison settle federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates the california public utilities commission ( puc ) and southern california edison ( edison ) today reached a settlement in the filed rate doctrine lawsuit edison filed in federal court against the puc . the settlement is intended to restore edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers ; limit ratepayers ' costs of paying off the debt ; and maintain the state ' s role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable , certain period of time . the terms of the settlement agreement include : ? edison will apply cash on hand , plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs , to paying off its back debt . the puc and edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt edison had at august 31 , 2001 , less the cash on hand on that date , less an additional $ 300 million adjustment . the amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $ 3 billion as of the end of this month . the parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap . ? edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003 , or on the full payment of its debt , if sooner . if edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003 , the commission retains the discretion to determine whether edison will pay a dividend in 2004 . edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005 . since edison ' s annual dividend has typically been about $ 400 million , edison ' s shareholders will have forgone at least $ 1 . 2 billion in dividends and possibly more , in addition to the $ 300 million adjustment . ? edison will apply 100 % of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the federal energy regulatory commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt . edison commits through court order to work with the puc and the attorney general in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers . ? the puc can direct edison to use $ 150 million each year for other utility purposes , including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies , which would otherwise be used to pay down the edison debt . ? the puc agrees not to lower edison ' s retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered . however , rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced dwr revenue needs . ? the puc agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate , to enable edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if edison ' s back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003 . ? there are no concessions of puc or state regulations or regulatory authority over edison , nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities . ? edison may make up to $ 900 million in capital expenditures annually . "" this settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power , while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of california , "" said loretta lynch , president of the puc . "" the settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers . "" this agreement settles a november 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by edison against the puc , in which edison claimed that the commission ' s actions in not providing sufficient retail rates , violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property . under this agreement , edison will release the puc from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the commission ' s decisions implementing ab lx , ab 6 x , and the turn accounting proposal . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : dasovich , jeff sent : tuesday , october 02 , 2001 4 : 42 pm to : dasovich , jeff ; kean , steven j . ; belden , tim ; sharp , vicki ; blachman , jeremy ; comnes , alan ; tribolet , michael ; walsh , kristin ; delainey , david ; leff , dan ; frazier , lamar ; keeney , kevin ; gahn , scott ; swain , steve ; lavorato , john ; kaufman , paul ; steffes , james d . ; calger , christopher f . ; mara , susan ; black , don ; richter , jeff ; kitchen , louise ; dietrich , janet ; mara , susan ; robertson , linda ; kingerski , harry ; denne , karen ; palmer , mark a .

Date: Not suppliedInterview with cartoonist Ted Rall, who has traveled to South Asia recently, 
and has tips on how to deal with bribe-hungry border guards and the like:     Rall: Now I realize that's just the way it is, and I know how to do it and 
    get away without paying a bribe, or paying something very modest. You have 
    to show them that you know the routine and that you know you don't have to 
    give them anything, and just have a low-key demeanor. But if you get angry, 
    that's just going to make things worse for you. You get out of your vehicle 
    and you walk up to them -- you don't try to avoid these guys; you don't try 
    to avoid their eyes -- you go up with a big smile, give them a big 
    handshake and sort of rub their shoulders and say, ""Hey, great to see you. 
    You're my new best friend for the next five minutes.""     GROTH: Basically act like a used car salesman.     RALL: It's exactly like that! You always carry cigarettes. You offer them a 
    cigarette, and you say, ""Hey, what's goin' on? How's it goin'? Great. 
    Here's my documents. How's the road?"" Just small talk, because these guys 
    are bored. They're in the middle of nowhere, and you're sometimes the only 
    vehicle they've seen for many hours. They're often very drunk, so you just 
    have to be cool.  Link[1] Discuss[2][1] http://www.tcj.com/247/i_rall.html

[I'm sure somebody will tell me about the original source; it's in a
number of places on the web. -gkm]Forwarded-by: Colin Burgess The Beer Scooter How many times have you woken up in the morning after a hard night
drinking and thought 'How on earth did I get home? As hard as you
try, you cannot piece together your return journey from the pub to
your house. The answer to this puzzle is that you used a Beer
Scooter.The Beer Scooter is a mythical form of transport, owned and leased
to the drunk by Bacchus the Roman god of wine. Bacchus has branched
out since the decrease in the worship of the Roman Pantheon and
has bought a large batch of these magical devices. The Beer Scooter
works in the following fashion:-The passenger reaches a certain level of drunkenness and the
""slurring gland"" begins to give off a pheromone. Bacchus or one of
his many sub-contractors detects this pheromone and sends down a
winged Beer Scooter. The scooter scoops up the passenger and deposits
them in their bedroom via the Trans-Dimensional Portal. This is
not cheap to run, so a large portion of the passenger's in-pocket
cash is taken as payment.This answers the second question after a night out 'How did I spend
so much money?'Unfortunately, Beer Scooters have a poor safety record and are
thought to be responsible for over 90% of all UDI (Unidentified
Drinking Injuries).  An undocumented feature of the beer scooter
is the destruction of time segments during the trip. The nature of
Trans-Dimensional Portals dictates that time will be lost, seemingly
unaccounted for.This answers a third question after a night out 'What the hell
happened?'With good intentions, Bacchus opted for the REMIT (Removal of
Embarrassing Moments In Time) add on, that automatically removes,
in descending order, those parts in time regretted most. Unfortunately
one person's REMIT is not necessarily the REMIT of another and
quite often lost time is regained in discussions over a period of
time. Independent studies have also shown that Beer Goggles often
cause the scooter's navigation system to malfunction thus sending
the passenger to the wrong bedroom, often with horrific consequences.
With recent models including a GPS, Bacchus made an investment in
a scooter drive-thru chain specialising in half eaten kebabs and
pizza crusts.Another question answered!! For the family man, Beer Scooters come
equipped with flowers picked from other people's garden and
Thump-A-Lot boots (Patent Pending). These boots are designed in
such a way that no matter how quietly you tip-toe up the stairs,
you are sure to wake up your other half. Special anti-gravity
springs ensure that you bump into every wall in the house and the
CTSGS (Coffee Table Seeking Guidance System) explains the bruised
shins. The final add-on Bacchus saw fit to invest in for some
scooters is the TAS (Tobacco Absorption System). This explains how
one person can apparently get through 260 Marlboro Lights in a
single night.PS: Don't forget the on-board heater, which allows you to comfortably
get home from the pub in sub-zero temperatures, wearing just a
T-shirt.

Years of looking at it will turn you into an arsehole. They haven't found a hobbit that can code, so mortal humans have to
suffice. Kate

2 ) resources must generally be installed locally to be usable ( and of course precisely how this happens , what operating systems are supported etc . varies from case to case ) . the consequences of 1 ) are that although resources share some structure in common ( lexicons are organised around words , for example ) this commonality is wasted when it comes to using a new resource ( the developer has to learn everything afresh each time ) and that work which seeks to investigate or exploit commonalities between resources ( e . g . to link several lexicons to an ontology ) has to first build a layer of access routines on top of each resources . so , for example , if we wish to do task-based evaluation of lexicons by measuring the relative performance of an information extraction system with different instantiations of lexical resource , we might end up writing code to translate several different resources into sql or sgml . the consequence of 2 ) is that there is no way to "" try before you buy "" : no way to examine a data resource for its suitability for your needs before licencing it . correspondingly there is no way for a resource provider to expose limitted access to their products for advertising purposes , or gain revenue through piecemeal supply of sections of a resource . this workshop will discuss ways to overcome these barriers . the proposers will discuss a new method for distributing and accessing language resources involving the development of a common programmatic model of the various resources types , implemented in corba idl and / or java , along with a distributed server for non-local access . this model is being designed as part of the gate project ( general architecture for text engineering : http : / / www . dcs . shef . ac . uk / research / groups / nlp / gate / ) and goes under the provisional title of an active creole server . ( creole : collection of reusable objects for language engineering . currently creole supports only algortihmic objects , but will be extended to data objects . ) a common model of language data resources would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs . at the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources ( e . g . lexicons are about words ) ; at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources . programmatic access would be available at all levels , allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an exciting element of the work could be to provide algorithms to dynamically merge common resources what we ' re suggesting initially is not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to existing resources . this is not a new standards initiative , but a way to build on previous initiatives . of course , the production of a common model that fully expressed all the subtleties of all resources would be a large undertaking , but we believe that it can be done incrementally , with useful results at each stage . early versions will stop decomposing the object structure of resources at a fairly high level , leaving the developer to handle the data structures native to the resources at the leaves of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucures . program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilks hamish cunningham wim peters remi zajac roberta catizone paola velardi maria teresa pazienza roberto basili bran boguraev sergei nirenburg james pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum",0

  Gaim Changelog
    http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ChangeLogGaim is an instant messaging client based on the published TOC
protocol from AOL. The developers of Gaim, an instant messenger client
that combines several different networks, found a vulnerability in the
hyperlink handling code. The 'Manual' browser command passes an
untrusted string to the shell without escaping or reliable quoting,
permitting an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the users
machine. Unfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before the
user clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren't
vulnerable.The fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browser
command to the shell. Commands which contain the %s in quotes will
need to be amended, so they don't contain any quotes. The 'Manual'
browser command can be edited in the 'General' pane of the
'Preferences' dialog, which can be accessed by clicking 'Options' from
the login window, or 'Tools' and then 'Preferences' from the menu bar
in the buddy list window.Please download Gaim 0.59.1 or later using Red Carpet. You may also

Marc -- Since perl itself is a scripting language, and allows code to be eval'ed,
I can't see why we need to go the whole hog and implement another
turing-complete scripting language in perl.Let's go back to *why* this would be useful.  As far as I can see, you're
proposing this to deal with multi-match rules.  There's already a tracker
in the bug DB for these, with a proposed implementation.  http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47I think this might have stalled due to shortcomings in the existnig
proposal, so I've just added my own thoughts on how to implement them. ;)
Comments on the proposed system would be welcome folks.... reply to the
bug db.--j.--

8094,"review of arboreal for windows review of : arboreal for windows , cascadilla press . by dr . matthew crocker ( mwc @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk ) centre for cognitive science , university of edinburgh . arboreal for windows ( henceforth , arborwin ) is a package designed to facilitate drawing trees within microsoft ( tm ) windows ( tm ) applications . arborwin consists simply of a truetype ( tm ) font in which keys are mapped to tree component shaped characters rather than standard keyboard symbols . the advantage of drawing trees in this way is that arborwin is very portable , and can be used in any wysiwyg windows ( tm ) application which allows you to select specific fonts ( i . e . most ) . the disadvantage , broadly , is that ` type-setting ' or layout of the trees is left to the user . the ` characters ' of arborwin include left , right , vertical , and ` triangle ' branches - - each of several widths ( but all the same height ) . the font is also fully scalable . in general , i found that arborwin behaved as intended , given that it is simply a font-based package . its most basic limitation is that there is a relatively small selection of branch sizes ( i . e . how narrow or wide a branch is ) . in practice , the most common problem i encountered was that ` triangle ' branches ( eg , for phrase without internal structure ) could n't be made wide enough . . . given that one often wants to put fairly long phrases under these . the only way to increase the width was to increase the point size for the branch ; but this also increases the height of the particular branch , and makes trees look disproportionate and inconsistent . being font-based , however , also means it cannot attain the flexibility of alternative packages ( eg , the ` tree ' package for latex ) . the ' tree ' package , for example , takes as input a declarative tree specification ( as a bracketed list ) and then automatically typesets the tree , and also permits crossing branches , and upside-down trees . since typesetting is automatic , the tree formatting is consistent , and tailored to the size / length of terminals ( including the triangle branches ) . overall the package is simple to use and quite effective if your requirements ( in terms of both sophistication , and layout quality ) are not too demanding . if greater flexibility , consistency , and quality is required , then i believe there is still no substitute for latex and its associated packages . dr . matthew crocker , esrc research fellow centre for cognitive science university of edinburgh mwc @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk",0

18153,"more on human subjects a number of months ago i raised the issue of dealing with human subjects committees , since our department was being ( as we perceived it ) hassled by our own committee . i received numerous responses , which i have since forwarded to the lsa social issues ( or something ) committee . the responses varied from shocked outrage that anyone would look over our ( collective ) shoulders from shocked outrage that i would consider doing any research without asking permission . the primary hassle , which was reflected again in the more recent posting on the subject , is that linguistic research normally involves using a tape recorder . federal guidelines require ( so i am told ) a special , and more complex class of review if the data is being taped . in our case , this involves a full committee review , which takes two to three weeks , rather than the ` expedited ' review , which takes only a few days . we are still negotiating on whether class projects need to be cleared class by class ( which we hope ) or instead , student by student . given that students normally take at least half a semester to discover what they want to do , if it will then require an additional two or three weeks to get permission to do it , much linguistic classroom research may get halted . i would be greatly interested in hearing from people on the list who have been able to persuade their human subjects committees to issue any kind of ` blanket ' permission for certain kinds of research . when we suggested this possibility we were told that nobody 's research was privileged , and that if { sociology , psychology anthropology . . . } had to go through the process , so did we . in any case , as a result of my attempting to be law abiding , i almost lost an informant , whose data i had recorded illegally . i asked him to recite the nursery rhymes , then requested permission to do so . shortly afterwards , he left town , never to be seen again . sigh . . . any suggestions on getting expedited reviews , blanket permissions , other speeded up ways of being permitted to tape record linguistic data without supreme court approval would be appreciated . geoff nathan < ga3662 @ siucvmb . siu . edu > southern illinois university at carbondale",0

' complex construction ' because i do n't think that i share the same view as others on the importance / necessity of this distinction - - indeed , it is a bit ironic that another implication of sapir / whorf is that the view that our language is made up out of ' words ' and ' grammar ' ( constructions ) is precisely the kind of objectification , which we would expect and which formal distributional analyses show to be a simplification ) . as jonathan states , "" figuring out just what counts as a simple , lexicalised form is * very * hard in yup ' ik , given that it has a rich , higly productive derivational morphology "" . i agree and the answer would eventually have to draw lines along continua that i do n't think will be labelled ' lexical ' vs . ' construct ' ( and sapir offered some nice theoretical machinery for these kinds of comparative distinctions too ) . i still see only four ' arbitrary and unmotivated ' forms that deal specifically with 's now ' ( i . e . , snow , slush , blizzard , flurry ) . i ' ll leave it to others to decide whether or not various dialects of eskimo have more or less , but even if the point should fail here it still has life to it . so , i still find myself agreeing with the original insight . the point - - and not all that it has been used to argue - - has always seemed obvious to me . perhaps if we narrow the scope of the relevant speech community and bring it closer to home , it is easier to see . would n't we all accept the idea that _ on average _ lawyers ( vs . non-lawyers ) have more distinct forms for legal concepts than do others outside this community / culture ?

fans to vote on which track _they'd_ like to see as a single. The one they 
picked just entered the UK charts at number 9! Bet that'll piss off the major

Matched with a simple spam reporting scheme, this could keep the
training up to date with little effort.  I've sketched out an approach
a listserver like Mailman could do along these lines and if I get some
free time I'll hack something together.I like the idea of a POP proxy which is classifying messages as
they're pulled from the server.  The easiest way for such a beast to
be notified of spam might be to simply save the spam in a special
folder or file that the POP proxy would periodically consult.-Barry

military conflict with Iraq. At a recent function honoring America's
war widows, Bush sported a visible erection when his speech turned to
the subject of the Middle East.'Believe me when I say this. With or without the help of other
nations, with or without UN approval, we will penetrate Iraq's
borders. With overwhelming force, we will pound Iraq over and over
again without ceasing. And, once its leaders concede defeat, we will
seed Iraq with American-style democracy.'Aides say the podium was scrubbed down thoroughly after the event with

> You have not explained why the increase in CO2 concentrations is not
> contributing to increasing global temperature.
There are a number of reasons to think that CO2 is not important to
controlling global temperature and that much of the CO2 increase may not
be anthropogenic. Some recent research points worth mentioning:Recent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and
temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest
correlation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases
are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the
increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature
preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done
of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are
correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly
causative. There is a lot of evidence that CO2 levels are regulated in a
fairly stable fashion.  I don't believe anyone really has an
authoritative answer as to exactly how this works yet.With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to
point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly
regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.  At previous cycle
peaks, the concentrations were similar to what they are now.  If this
cycle has any validity (and we only have good data for 4-5 complete
cyclical periods, but which look surprisingly regular in shape and
time), then we should be almost exactly at a peak right now.  As it
happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous
cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. In other
words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, but it looks a lot like we
would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical
record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2
concentrations.Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately
affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely
predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative
feedback systems mentioned above.Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it
makes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and
methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule
basis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something
that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the
biosphere.CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent
studies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a
passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.  I certainly don't
think it is a healthy fixation if we're actually interested in
understanding warming trends.Cheers,-James Rogers

( nor has it explained the extensive use of star wars - related names by the related - party companies . ) it ' s not immediately clear what es power 3 is or does . so far , subpoenas issued by lawyers suing enron have determined the names of senior officers of es power 3 and its formation date , january 1999 . among es power 3 ' s senior executives are enron ceo ken lay , listed as a director , and mcmahon and fastow , listed as executive vice presidents . a raft of external directors are named as es power 3 directors , including comdisco ceo norman blake and ronnie chan , chairman of the hong kong - based hang lung group . a comdisco spokeswoman says blake isn ' t commenting on matters concerning enron and a call to the hang lung group wasn ' t immediately returned . demands , demands rating agencies moody ' s , fitch and s & p recently put enron ' s credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an ljm deal that led to the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity . enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade . but its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade , or junk , bonds , suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely . if enron ' s rating drops below investment grade , it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $ 3 . 4 billion in off - balance sheet obligations . in addition , many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade . friday , the company drew down $ 3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations . raising cash in the cp market could be tough when investors are jittery about enron ' s condition . this week , a number of energy market players reduced exposure to enron . however , in a friday press release , ceo lay said that enron was the "" market - maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets . "" he added : "" it is evident that our customers view enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets . "" mcmahon reportedly objected to fastow ' s role in ljm , allegedly believing it posed fastow with a conflict of interests . but he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he ' s connected to don ' t do the same . enron has said that its board fully approved of the ljm deals that fastow was involved in . now , board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity . under the radar : enron ' s flickering bulb by christopher edmonds special to thestreet . com 10 / 26 / 2001 05 : 08 pm edt url : while the bulb at enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) may not have burnt out , it ' s clearly flickering . to date , investors aren ' t sure whether chairman and ceo ken lay is up to the task of re - energizing the company he once built to greatness . what ' s happened at the houston energy giant - turned - dwarf could ' ve been imagined with any number of ne ' er - do - well companies during the well - chronicled bubble . but this is enron . as one longtime enron bull and shareholder said , "" i never had to worry about enron ' s ability to survive until this week . i still find it hard to believe . "" peter eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling enron ' s adventures for some time . if you ' d listened to him earlier this year , you ' d have profited from his knowledge . his reporting on enron ' s partnership shenanigans to the departure of chief financial officer andrew fastow has been outstanding . the rumors - - from a pending bankruptcy to a justice department investigation - - are , for now , just that . and , enron did not single - handedly cause the california power crisis , nor is royal dutch / shell ( rd : nyse - news - commentary ) about to make a bid to buy the company . sources do tell me that head - count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business . and , while former ceo jeff skilling shares culpability for the current mess , his departure appears only indirectly related to enron ' s current woes . now , enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and , more importantly , its reputation . the company ' s challenge but what does enron do now ? it ' s very simple . come clean , clean up the mess and refocus on its core business : wholesale energy markets , risk management and retail energy services . they support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks . "" our gut feel is that enron can pull it off , and long - term investors should hold firm , as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings , with upside potential to $ 25 per share over the next 12 - 18 months , "" says jeff dietert , power analyst at simmons & co . and a member of the tsc energy roundtable . "" we believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery . "" dietert outlines four challenges for enron . one , management must regain the street ' s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance - sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow . two , enron must maintain its investment - grade credit rating . three , enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans . four , enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write - down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book . straightforward ? yes . easy to accomplish ? no . although enron says additional write - downs are unlikely - - except a $ 200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change - - analysts aren ' t so sure . they ' re focused on the company ' s global assets portfolio , sporting $ 6 billion in book value but generating an ebit ( earnings before interest and taxes ) loss of $ 18 million over the past 12 months . the divestitures include $ 390 million in exploration and production assets in india , $ 250 million in a puerto rico power plant and $ 250 million in a brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of portland general , which is set to close in 2002 . there will likely be others . however , enron has to execute here , and given the current state of its affairs , the seller will feel the pressure . the credit - rating issue is a fine line . the current ratings , bbb + from standard & poor ' s and baal from moody ' s , are three levels above non - investment grade . however , both rating agencies now have enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades . dietert estimates that enron ' s debt - to - market cap will be about 48 % by year - end , and the company has interest coverage ( ebitda / interest expense ) of about 3 . 5 times . by comparison , the average s the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades ; potentially lower credit ratings force counter - parties to reduce exposure to enron , limiting enron ' s ability to generate earnings and cash flow . "" it ' s time for enron to grow up . despite a lot of uncertainties and risk , i think it will . investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy . it ' s a tough call that requires strict , individual discipline . there ' s an irony to this whole story , especially in enron ' s lack of candor in reporting its financial results . in a much - lauded advertising campaign , enron , looking to challenge conventional wisdom , asks the simple question , "" why ? ask why . "" investors are now asking . it ' s time for ken lay to answer . first things first many readers have asked about my relative quietness this week . thank you for your concern . my father has fallen ill after fighting the effects of a brain tumor for more than a decade . the choice was easy . i ' m with him and my family . enjoy your weekend with family and friends . dj enron unit , new england market downplay report of default 2001 - 10 - 26 17 : 14 ( new york ) by kristen mcnamara of dow jones newswires new york ( dow jones ) - - enron corp . ' s ( ene ) retail sales unit defaulted on its credit requirement in new england ' s wholesale power market this month , but the event was neither unique nor newsworthy , the energy company and the organization that developed the market ' s rules said friday . the operator of the region ' s wholesale power market informed enron energy services last week that , for the third time in 12 months , it had traded a greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at risk for expulsion from new england ' s market . but it was administrative mixups , rather than financial problems , that triggered the warning , which a few other companies have also received in the past , the market ' s rulemaker said . "" i can state with considerable confidence that there have been other participants "" that have defaulted on their credit agreements , "" and it ' s never been in the news , "" said david doot , secretary and general counsel for the new england power pool , which developed the policies governing the region ' s electricity market . "" my instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of proportion . "" news of the enron unit ' s default appeared in a trade publication and a major metropolitan newspaper this week , as enron ' s dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company ' s stock and bond prices . enron energy services never received word that it had defaulted on its bonding requirement twice before , because both times it corrected the problem within a day , spokeswoman peggy mahoney said . the letter sent by iso new england , which operates the region ' s power market , to notify the enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong person , delaying the company ' s response , mahoney said . "" clearly , it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit , "" mahoney said . the company resolved the problem by oct . 19 , mahoney said . iso new england spokeswoman ellen foley confirmed friday that the company had cured its default . it ' s rare for a company to default three times , but it has happened on occasion , foley and doot said . "" i won ' t say it ' s commonplace , but i won ' t say it ' s unusual for a participant to find itself out of compliance , "" doot said . "" those things have in fact happened from time to time .

White Horse cut in to the hills at Kilburn, which dates back to the 1700s.But no-one reported anything to the police.A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said no reports had been received but 
he had seen ""a red blob"" on the horse and had sent officers to investigate.In Uffington, no-one in the village had heard anything about the reported 
incident. A spokesman for Thames Valley police said he was not aware of any 
complaints.Activists say the image in Oxfordshire was drawn in paint used for marking 
lines on grass tennis courts and will wash away in the first rains.

9394,"The Electronic Telegraph Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham
 or sick of Sheffield.
 
 Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey
 this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps
 heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.
 
 Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied
 with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to
 emigrate to provincial Russia.
 
 After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek
 article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other
 side.
 
 ""The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city
 deep in the provinces where things are quiet,"" said Kommersant.
 
 ""In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly
 cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are
 becoming 'traditionally' relaxed.""
 
 The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of
 tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.
 
 It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the
 famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also
 opening time in the nation's vodka shops.
 
 And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that
 ""the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be
 enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their
 life.
 
 ""The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle
 of whisky for kopecks.""
 
 There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a
 halfpenny in sterling.
 
 The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton
 will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine
 vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among
 diehard alcoholics.
 
 While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The
 newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail
 soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British
 settler should overcome the difficulty.
 
 ""For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut
 off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle.""
 
 One or two potential emigrÃ©s might be deterred by language difficulties. There
 are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the
 Mongolian border.
 
 However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a
 deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in
 which they would like to live.
 
 France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country ""where English is only known
 by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists"".
 
 Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian
 weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.
 
 Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.
 And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place
 in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures
 that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the
 permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.
 
 Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the
 climatic problems, it said that ""thanks to global warming this difficulty will
 solve itself"".
 
 Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in
 Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.
 
 ""Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33
 million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found
 amongst our citizens.""
 
 Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons
 surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their
 preferred new home.

NO MORE XIMIAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  Man, that was annoying.    Anyway, I have returned to Redhat 7.3 on my root filesystem (saved my home directories, music and games on other partitions) and while I have the 8.0 stuff in the list, everything I want to upgrade requires 200+ RPMs.    I'm not opposed to this, but apt is.  ""apt-get dist-upgrade"" dumps core.    What's the inside secret here, or do I just start searching mirrors for the ISO and get over it?

[ n + v ] v verbal compounding in catalan to be more clear we enumerate the relevant characteristics of our compounds . 1 . first of all , we must say that catalan is a vo language . 2 . our compounding looks like a process of noun incorporation where the incorporated noun within the lexical item is the ineternal argument in the syntactic structure . see ( 1 ) : ( 1 ) a . el cacador trenca la cama de l ' ocell . the hunter breaks the leg of the bird b . el cacador camtrenca l ' ocell . the hunter leg + breaks the bird 3 . nevertheless , the noun-incorporation doestn ' t affect to the capacity of the verb of assigning acusative case , this is , the complex verb remains transitive . 4 . this kind of "" noun-incorporation "" is only possible when the noun incorporated is a in inalienable possession noun ( ipn ) and the new internal argument of the complex verb is the possessor . see ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) : ( 2 ) a . corferir to heat + hurt b . colltorcer to neck + twist ( 3 ) a . * cadiratrencar to chair + break * ferrotorcer to iron + twist 5 . we hypothesise that the ipn acsts as a kind of modifier in the complex verbal form and it does n't act as a verbal argument "" most of the people gave us references , they are listed below . most of the answers coincide with the belief that this kind of verbal compounds are backformations from adjectives ( in - er ) or nominal compounds . then "" to baby sit "" comes from "" baby sitter "" for example . another repeated idea is that they are n't productive in languages as english , or romance languages . nevertheless , we still claim that both questions , the productiviy and the backformation , are not so clear in catalan . bertienetto notes that maybe there is a relation between this kind of nominal incorporation and a progressive aspect ( it has been also noted in the literature about the theme ; see , for example miller g .

The problem has now been isolated and HP has been preparing a fix, which will be available within the next 48 hours.3) We won't comment on the specifics of our discussions with SnoSoft. However, we take our customers' security requirements very seriously and have a strong track record following industry-standard security practices.4) Where and how the DMCA should be applied is a matter of great controversy. The reported letter to SnoSoft was not consistent or indicative of HP's policy. We can say emphatically that HP will not use the DMCA to stifle research or impede the flow of information that would benefit our customers and improve their system security.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Robin D.

Forwarded-by: FlowerDid you know that you can tell from the skin whether a person is
sexually active or not?1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when woman
   make love they produce more of the hormone estrogen, which makes
   hair shiny and skin smooth.2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering
   dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses
   the pores and makes your skin glow.3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that
   romantic dinner.4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches
   and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable
   than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers!5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases the body
   endorphin into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and
   leaving you with a feeling of well-being.6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually
   active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called
   pheromones.  These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE
   EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages
   saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid
   that causes decay, preventing plaque build-up.9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release
   the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain.10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a national
    antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.ENJOY SEX!

12202,"new uci dissertation in linguistics irvine linguistics students association is pleased to announce the publication of the following uci dissertation in linguistics . overt movement as a reflex of morphology hajime ikawa under the framework of the minimalist program , this thesis answers fundamental questions with overt movement such as ( i ) what forces its application , and ( ii ) what is responsible for its presence / absence in languages . chapter 1 raises the above-mentioned fundamental questions with overt movement . it is shown that the current minimalist framework , as it is , does not explain any of them in a principled way . chapter 2 introduces two major operations assumed by the minimalist program , merge and move . chapter 3 first undertakes to identify the cause of overt movement in a way consistent with the basic minimalist assumption that any application of overt movement , as a departure from the best case , should be forced from the outside of the core computational system . it is claimed that overt movement is directly driven by the module morphology , which applies right after spell - out ; overt movement , whether head-movement or xp - movement , is forced to apply to morphologically support the suffixal functional heads . this claim automatically leads to derive the absence of overt movement in consistently head-final languages like japanese from their word order . the proposed analysis not only provides principled answers for the fundamental questions with overt movement , but eliminates one of the most problematic aspects of the minimalist program , the strong / weak distinction among functional heads . chapter 4 discusses various implications and consequences of the proposed analysis for overt movement , phrase structure , the computational system , and typological variations . chapter 5 discusses overt np - raising as overt movement indirectly driven by the morphological properties of agr . it is claimed that a subject in nominative-accusative languages overtly raises not to directly support agr , but to provide f-features for agr so that it can be successfully suffixed to a verb as the overt realization of the f-features of an np . from this , asymmetries between overt np - raising and other overt movements directly driven by morphology naturally follow . also available : > uci dissertations in linguistics griffith , teresa a . 1996 projecting transitivity and agreement takano , yuji 1996 movement and parametric variation in syntax zoerner , cyril edward 1995 coordination : the syntax of &p us $ 14 each , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 3 ( 1997 ) . edited by luther > chen - sheng liu and kazue takeda articles appearing in the third volume are : brian agbayani : category raising , adjunction , and minimality lisa lai - shen cheng : "" partial "" wh - movement naoki fukui : attract and the a - over - a principle toru ishii : the "" crossing "" constraint and the minimal link condition luther chen - sheng liu : light verb and accusative - ing gerund in taiwanese yuji takano : object shift as short scrambling kazue takeda : a note on locality of category movement and feature movement sze - wing tang : the parametric approach to the resultative construction in chinese and english miyoko yashui : identification of ellipses and other empty categories us $ 14 , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 2 : proceedings of the south > western optimality theory workshop ( swot ii ) . edited by brian agbayani > and naomi harada us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 1 . edited by brian agbayani , > kazue takeda and sze - wing tang us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling shipping and handling ( per item ) domestic : $ 5 ;

rather to show others that there is a vocal and violent opposition to his
views. With such flagrant showings of opposition there would be more
coverage of the opposing ideas and thus the spreading of the dissenting
meme. A viri need not comply with the wishes of the attacked host, rather
the host had better make some antibodies or learn to adapt.Point the second. Historicaly the ""in yer face"" mode of confrontation has
been used to gain popular support and to grow from seeds ""grass roots""
movements. Witness the big bold ""in yer face"" signature of Hancock on the
""in yer  face"" Declaration of the american colonies to the governing
powers of england. Witness also the chicago seven, Others will follow in
examplare  form upon digging.Now point the third, is it annoying? Yes, and if your annoyed then the ""in
yer facers"" have done thier job. Sad to say the polite persnikiters are
teh very fule the ""in yer facers"" hope to ignite. If your burning, your
being used.Pointed the personal...The politics of the polite are more often the
refuge of backstabings,  closed mouth recourlessness and hypocritcal
behavoirs. Id rather hear what those who oppose me have to say than
quietly be knifed by the slow hand of the coward.Seek not the polite or impolite but rather the reasons why.

these are bad mailing lists that don't drop bad mail addresses that become

In the Beginning ...July 23, 2002
By DENNIS OVERBYE 
 It has always been easy to make fun of cosmologists,
confined to a dust mote lost in space, pronouncing judgment
on the fate of the universe or the behavior of galaxies
billions of light-years away, with only a few scraps of
light as evidence. ""Cosmologists are often wrong,"" the Russian physicist Lev
Landau put it, ""but never in doubt."" For most of the 20th century, cosmology seemed less a
science than a religious war over, say, whether the
universe had a beginning, in a fiery Big Bang billions of
years ago, or whether it exists eternally in the so-called
Steady State. In the last few years, however, a funny thing has happened.
Cosmologists are beginning to agree with one another.
Blessed with new instruments like the Hubble Space
Telescope and other space-based observatories, a new
generation of their giant cousins on the ground and
ever-faster computer networks, cosmology is entering ""a
golden age"" in which data are finally outrunning
speculation. ""The rate at which we are learning and discovering new
things is just extraordinary,"" said Dr. Charles Bennett, an
astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
Md. As a result, cosmologists are beginning to converge on what
they call a ""standard model"" of the universe that is
towering in its ambition. It purports to trace, at least in
broad strokes, cosmic history from the millisecond after
time began, when the universe was a boiling stew of energy
and subatomic particles, through the formation of atoms,
stars, galaxies and planets to the vast, dilute, dark
future in which all of these will have died. The universe, the cosmologists say, was born 14 billion
years ago in the Big Bang. Most of its material remains
resides in huge clouds of invisible so-called dark matter,
perhaps elementary particles left over from the primordial
explosion and not yet identified. Within these invisible clouds, the glittery lights in the
sky that have defined creation for generations of humans
are swamped, like flecks of foam on a rolling sea. A good
case can be made, scientists now agree, that the universe
will go on expanding forever. In fact, recent observations have suggested that the
expansion of the universe is speeding up over cosmic time,
under the influence of a ""dark energy"" even more mysterious
than dark matter. Recently, a group of astronomers led by Dr. William
Percival at the University of Edinburgh combined data from
a variety of observations to compile, based on the simplest
theoretical model, what they say is the most precise
enumeration yet of the parameters that cosmologists have
been fighting about for all these decades. The universe, they calculated, is 13.89 billion years old,
plus or minus half a billion years. Only 4.8 percent of it
is made of ordinary matter. Matter of all types, known and
unknown, luminous and dark, accounts for just 27.5 percent.
The rest of creation, 72.5 percent, is the mysterious dark
energy, they reported in a paper submitted last month to
The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. It is a picture that in some ways is surprisingly simple,
satisfying long-held theoretical prejudices about how the
universe should be designed. Continued agreement with
coming experiments may mean that science is approaching the
end of a ""great program"" of cosmological tests that began
in the 1930's, Dr. P. J. E. Peebles of Princeton and Dr.
Bharat Ratra of Kansas State University said in the draft
of a coming article for The Reviews of Modern Physics. In other ways this new dark universe is utterly baffling, a
road map to new mysteries. Dr. Marc Davis, a cosmologist at
the University of California at Berkeley, called it ""a
universe chock full of exotics that don't make sense to
anybody."" Moreover there are some questions that scientists still do
not know how to ask, let alone answer, scientifically. Was
there anything before the Big Bang? Is there a role for
life in the cosmos? Why is there something rather than
nothing at all? Will we ever know? ""We know much, but we still understand very little,"" said
Dr. Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of
Chicago. The Big Question Expanding Forever, 
Or Big Crunch? The dim caves of Lascaux, the plains of
Stonehenge and the dreamtime tales of Australian aborigines
all testify to the need to explain the world and existence.
This quest took its present form in 1917. That was when
Albert Einstein took his new general theory of relativity,
which explained how matter and energy warp space-time to
produce gravity, and applied it to the universe. Einstein discovered that the cosmos as his theory described
it would be unstable, prone to collapse under its own
gravity. Astronomers, however, were sure that the universe
was stable. So Einstein added a fudge factor that he called
the cosmological constant to his equations. It acted as a
long-range repulsive force to counterbalance gravity. In 1929, the astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the
universe was expanding. The sky was full of distant
galaxies all rushing away from us and one another, as if
propelled by what the British astronomer Dr. Fred Hoyle
later called derisively a ""big bang."" The universe was not
stable and, thus, did not require counterbalancing.
Einstein abandoned his constant, referring to it as his
biggest blunder. But it would return to haunt cosmologists,
and the universe. Hoyle's term stuck, and the notion of an explosive genesis
became orthodoxy in 1965, when Dr. Arno Penzias and Dr.
Robert Wilson, radio astronomers at Bell Laboratories,
discovered a faint uniform radio glow that pervaded the
sky. It was, cosmologists concluded, the fading remnant of
the primordial fireball itself. Relieved of their fudge factor, the equations describing
Einstein's universe were simple. Dr. Allan Sandage, the
Carnegie Observatories astronomer, once called cosmology
""the search for two numbers"" - one, the Hubble constant,
telling how fast the universe is expanding, and the other
telling how fast the expansion is slowing, and thus whether
the universe will expand forever or not. The second number, known as the deceleration parameter,
indicated how much the cosmos had been warped by the
density of its contents. In a high-density universe, space
would be curved around on itself like a ball. Such a
universe would eventually stop expanding and fall back
together in a big crunch that would extinguish space and
time, as well as the galaxies and stars that inhabit them.
A low-density universe, on the other hand, would have an
opposite or ""open"" curvature like a saddle, harder to
envision, and would expand forever. In between with no overall warpage at all was a
""Goldilocks"" universe with just the right density to expand
forever but more and more slowly, so that after an infinite
time it would coast to a stop. This was a ""flat"" universe
in the cosmological parlance, and to many theorists the
simplest and most mathematically beautiful solution of all.
But the sky did not yield those cosmic numbers easily, even
with the help of the 200-inch Hale telescope on Palomar
Mountain in Southern California, dedicated in 1948, which
had been built largely for that task. Dr. Hubble wrote of
measuring shadows and searching ""among ghostly errors of
measurement for landmarks that are scarcely more
substantial."" The Dark Side Invisible Matter 
Molds Galaxies 
It was not till the mid-70's, a
quarter-century after the Palomar giant began operating,
that groups of astronomers reached the tentative conclusion
that the universe they could see - stars, gas, planets and
galaxies - did not have nearly enough gravitational oomph
to stop the cosmic expansion. ""So the universe will continue to expand forever and
galaxies will get farther and farther apart, and things
will just die,"" Dr. Sandage said at the time. But the Great Argument was just beginning. Apparently there
was a lot of the universe that astronomers could not see.
The stars and galaxies, were moving as if immersed in the
gravity of giant invisible clouds of so-called dark matter
- ""missing matter"" the Swiss astronomer Dr. Fritz Zwicky
labeled it in the 1930's. Many galaxies, for example, are rotating so fast that they
would fly apart unless they were being reined in by the
gravity of halos of dark matter, according to pioneering
observations by Dr. Vera Rubin of the Carnegie Institution
of Washington and her colleagues. Her measurements
indicated that these dark halos outweighed the visible
galaxies themselves from 5 to 10 times. But there could be
even more dark matter farther out in space, perhaps enough
to stop the expansion of the universe, eventually, some
theorists suggested. Luminous matter, the Darth Vaders of
the sky said, is like the snow on mountaintops. But what is the dark matter? While some of it is gas or
dark dim objects like stars and planets, cosmologists
speculate that most of it is subatomic particles left over
from the Big Bang. Many varieties of these particles are predicted by theories
of high-energy physics. But their existence has not been
confirmed or detected in particle accelerators. ""We theorists can invent all sorts of garbage to fill the
universe,"" Dr. Sheldon Glashow, a Harvard physicist and
Nobel laureate, told a gathering on dark matter in 1981. Collectively known as WIMP's, for weakly interacting
massive particles, such particles would not respond to
electromagnetism, the force responsible for light, and thus
would be unable to radiate or reflect light. They would
also be relatively slow-moving, or ""cold"" in physics
jargon, and thus also go by the name of cold dark matter. As Earth in its travels passed through the dark-matter
cloud that presumably envelops the Milky Way, the particles
would shoot through our bodies, rarely leaving a trace,
like moonlight through a window. But the collective gravity of such particles, cosmologists
say, would shape the cosmos and its contents. Gathering along the fault lines laid down by random
perturbations of density in the early universe, dark matter
would congeal into clouds with about the mass of 100,000
Suns. The ordinary matter that was mixed in with it would
cool and fall to the centers of the clouds and light up as
stars. The clouds would then attract other clouds. Through a
series of mergers over billions of years, smaller clouds
would assemble into galaxies, and the galaxies would then
assemble themselves into clusters of thousands of galaxies,
and so forth. Using the Hubble and other telescopes as time machines -
light travels at a finite speed, so the farther out
astronomers look the farther back in time they see -
cosmologists have begun to confirm that the universe did
assemble itself from the ""bottom up,"" as the dark matter
model predicts. Last year, two teams of astronomers reported seeing the
first stars burning their way out of the cloudy aftermath
of the Big Bang, when the universe was only 900 million
years old. The bulk of galaxy formation occurred when the
universe was a half to a quarter its present age,
cosmologists say. ""The big news in the last decade is that even half a
universe ago the universe looked pretty different,"" said
Dr. Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories in
Pasadena. Galaxies before then were small and irregular,
with no sign of the majestic spiral spider webs that
decorate the sky today. We would barely recognize our own Milky Way galaxy, if we
could see it five billion years ago when the Sun formed, he
said. ""By eight billion years back, it would be unrecognizable,""
said Dr. Dressler. Yet there are still many questions that the cold dark
matter model does not answer. Astronomers still do not
know, for example, how the first stars formed or why the
models of dark matter distribution don't quite fit in the
cores of some kinds of galaxies. Nor have the dark matter
particles themselves been unambiguously detected or
identified, despite continuing experiments. Some astronomers suggest that the discrepancies stem from
the inability of simple mathematical models to deal with
messy details of the real world. ""It's a huge mystery exactly how stars form,"" Dr. Richard
Bond of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics
said. ""We can't solve it now. So it's even harder to try to
solve them back then."" But others, notably Dr. Mordehai Milgrom, a theorist at the
Weizmann Institute in Israel, have suggested that modifying
the gravitational laws by which dark matter was deduced in
the first place would alleviate the need for dark matter
altogether. The Bang's Fuel Inflating One Ounce 
To a Whole Universe 
Clues to what had actually exploded
in the Big Bang emerged as an unexpected gift from another
great scientific quest: physicists' pursuit for a so-called
theory of everything that would unite all physical
phenomena in a single equation. Unable to build machines
powerful enough to test their most ambitious notions on
Earth, some theorists turned to the sky. ""The Big Bang is the poor man's particle accelerator,"" Dr.
Jakob Zeldovich, an influential Russian cosmologist, said. Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world
today - gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak
nuclear forces. But they suspect, based on data from
particle accelerators and high-powered theory, that those
are simply different manifestations of a single unified
force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest
moments. As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was
a fall from grace, and the laws of physics evolved, with
one force after another ""freezing out,"" or splitting away. In 1979, Dr. Alan Guth, now at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, realized that a hypothesized glitch in this
process would have had drastic consequences for the
universe. Under some circumstances, a glass of water can
stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees,
until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly
freeze, releasing latent heat in the process. Similarly,
the universe could ""supercool"" and stay in a unified state
too long. In that case, space itself would become
temporarily imbued with a mysterious kind of latent heat,
or energy. Inserted into Einstein's equations, the latent energy would
act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow
itself apart, Dr. Guth discovered in a calculation in 1979.
In far less than the blink of an eye, 10-37 second, a speck
much smaller than a proton would have swollen to the size
of a grapefruit and then resumed its more stately
expansion, with all of normal cosmic history before it,
resulting in today's observable universe - a patch of sky
and stars 14 billion light-years across. All, by the
magical-seeming logic of Einstein's equations, from about
an ounce of primordial stuff. ""The universe,"" Dr. Guth liked to say, ""might be the
ultimate free lunch."" Dr. Guth called his theory inflation. Inflation, as Dr.
Guth pointed out, explains why the universe is expanding.
Dr. Turner of the University of Chicago referred to it as
""the dynamite behind the Big Bang."" As modified and improved by Dr. Andrei Linde, now at
Stanford, and by Dr. Paul Steinhardt, now at Princeton and
Dr. Andreas Albrecht now at the University of California at
Davis, inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology ever
since. One of its great virtues, cosmologists say, is that
inflation explains the origin of galaxies, the main
citizens of the cosmos. The answer comes from the
paradoxical-sounding quantum rules that govern subatomic
affairs. On the smallest scales, according to quantum
theory, nature is lumpy, emitting even energy in little
bits and subject to an irreducible randomness. As a result,
so-called quantum fluctuations would leave faint lumps in
the early universe. These would serve as the gravitational
seeds for future galaxies and other cosmic structures. As a result of such successes, cosmologists have stuck with
the idea of inflation, even though, lacking the ability to
test their theories at the high energies of the Big Bang,
they have no precise theory about what might have actually
caused it. ""Inflation is actually a class of theories,""
said Dr. Guth. In the latest version, called ""chaotic inflation,"" Dr.
Linde has argued that quantum fluctuations in a myriad of
theorized force fields could have done the trick. Indeed, he and others now say they believe that inflation
can occur over and over, spawning an endless chain of
universes out of one another, like bubbles within bubbles. ""The universe inflates on top of itself,"" Dr. Linde told a
physics conference this spring in Princeton. ""It's
happening right now."" The Golden Age New Devices Detect 
Primordial Glow 
If the inflationary
theorists are right, the universe we see, the 14 billion
light-years, is just a tiny piece of a much vaster
universe, or even a whole ensemble of them, forever out of
our view. According to the theory, therefore, our own little patch of
the cosmos should appear geometrically ""flat,"" the way a
section of a balloon looks flat when viewed close up. This
was the universe long thought to be the most beautiful and
simple. But it required, by the logic of Einstein's general
relativity, that there be much more dark matter, or
something, to the universe, enough to ""flatten"" space-time,
than astronomers had found. In fact, this prescription was so hard to reconcile with
other observations, of galaxies and their evolutions, that
by 1991 some astronomers and press reports suggested that
the entire theoretical edifice of inflation to blow up the
universe and cold dark matter to fill it, not to say the
Big Bang itself, might have to be junked. So it was with a sigh of relief that cosmologists greeted
the announcement in April 1992 that NASA's Cosmic
Background Explorer, or COBE, satellite had succeeded in
discerning faint blotches in the primordial cosmic radio
glow. These were the seeds from which, inflation predicted, large
cosmic structures would eventually grow. ""If you're religious, it's like seeing God,"" said Dr.
George Smoot, a physicist from the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory who led the COBE team. Astronomers say COBE signaled a transition in which heroic
ideas about the universe began to be replaced by heroic
data, as long-planned new telescopes and other instruments
went into operation. A year later, skywalking astronauts corrected the Hubble
telescope's myopic vision. The cosmic background radiation
has come in for particular scrutiny from new radio
telescopes mounted in balloons and on mountaintops. The
news has been good, though not decisive, for inflation. For three years, a series of increasingly high-resolution
observations has confirmed that the pattern of blotches
stippling the remnant of the primordial fireball is
consistent with the predictions from inflation and cold
dark matter. The instruments have now mapped details small
enough to have been the seeds of modern clusters of
galaxies. ""I'm completely snowed by the cosmic background radiation,""
Dr. Guth said. ""The signal was so weak it wasn't even
detected until 1965, and now they're measuring fluctuations
of one part in 100,000."" Perhaps most important, the analysis of the fluctuations
indicates that the universe has a ""flat"" geometry, as
predicted by inflation. That was a triumph. Although
observations could not prove that inflation was right, a
nonflat universe would have been a blow to the theory, and
to cosmological orthodoxy. ""Inflation, our boldest and most promising theory of the
earliest moments of creation, passed its first very
important test,"" Dr. Turner said at the time. The most precise measurements of the cosmic background, at
least in the near future, are generally expected to come
late this year from NASA's Microwave Anisotropy Project, or
MAP, satellite, which was launched into space last year on
June 30. MAP will be followed by the European Space
Agency's Planck satellite, in 2006. It is highly unlikely that MAP or Planck will be able to
detect what Dr. Turner calls ""the smoking gun signature of
inflation."" The violent stretching of the universe should
roil space-time with so-called gravitational waves that
would leave a faint imprint on the cosmic fireball. Detecting those waves would not only confirm inflation, but
also might help scientists establish what caused the
inflation in the first place, giving science its first look
at the strange physics that prevailed when creation was
only about a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of
a second old. The Universe's Fate Bleak Implications 
Of `Dark Energy' In 1998, two competing teams of
astronomers startled the scientific world with the news
that the expansion of the universe seemed to be speeding up
under the influence of a mysterious antigravity that seems
embedded in space itself and that is hauntingly reminiscent
of Einstein's old, presumably discredited, cosmological
constant. ""Dark energy,"" the phenomenon was quickly named. If dark
energy is real and the acceleration continues, the galaxies
will eventually speed away from one another so quickly that
they couldn't see one another. The universe would become
cold and empty as the continued acceleration sucked away
the energy needed for life and thought. It would be ""the worst possible universe,"" for the quality
and quantity of life, said Dr. Lawrence Krauss, a physicist
at Case Western Reserve University. Dr. Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, called the discovery of dark energy ""the
strangest experimental finding since I've been in physics.""
The discovery was a surprise to the astronomers involved.
Neither team had expected to find the universe
accelerating. They had each set out to measure by how much
the expansion of the universe was slowing because of the
gravity of its contents and thus settle the question of its
fate. One team was led by Dr. Saul Perlmutter, a physicist at
Lawrence Berkeley. The other team was a band of astronomers
led by Dr. Brian Schmidt of Mount Stromlo and the Siding
Spring Observatory in Australia. Each group employed far-flung networks of telescopes,
including the Hubble, and the Internet to find and monitor
certain exploding stars, or supernovas, as cosmic beacons.
Such explosions, the death rattles of massive stars, are
powerful enough to be seen clear across the universe when
the universe was younger and, presumably, expanding faster.
Leapfrogging each other across the universe, the two teams,
propitiously for their credibility, arrived at the same
answer at the same time: the cosmos was not slowing at all;
it was speeding up. Dr. Perlmutter, who had once resented the competition,
conceded, ""With only one group, it would have been a lot
harder to get the community to buy into such a surprising
result."" ""This was a very strange result,"" said Dr. Adam Riess, a
member of Dr. Schmidt's team. ""It was the opposite of what
we thought we were doing."" The results have sent Einstein's old cosmological constant
to the forefront of cosmology. Despite his disavowal, the
constant had never really gone away and had in fact been
given new life by quantum physics. Einstein had famously
rejected quantum's randomness, saying God didn't play dice.
But it justified, in retrospect, his fudge factor. According to the uncertainty principle, a pillar of quantum
theory, empty space was not empty, but rather foaming with
the energy of so-called virtual particles as they flashed
in and out of existence on borrowed energy. This so-called
vacuum energy could repel, just like Einstein's old
cosmological constant, or attract. The case for dark energy got even stronger a year later,
when the cosmic background observations reported evidence
of a flat universe. Because astronomers had been able to
find only about a third as much matter, both dark and
luminous, as was needed by Einstein's laws to create a flat
geometry, something else had to be adding to it. The discovery of dark energy exemplified Dr. Zeldovich's
view of the universe as the poor man's particle
accelerator, and it caught the physicists flat-footed,
somewhat to the pride of the astronomers. ""A coming of age of astronomy,"" Dr. Dressler called it.
What is dark energy? The question now hangs over the
universe. Is it really Einstein's old fudge factor returned to haunt
his children? In that case, as the universe expands and the
volume of space increases, astronomers say, the push
because of dark energy will also increase, accelerating the
galaxies away from one another faster and faster, leading
to a dire dark future. Other physicists, however, have pointed out that the
theories of modern physics are replete with mysterious
force fields, collectively called ""quintessence,"" that
might or might not exist, but that could temporarily
produce negative gravity and mimic the action of a
cosmological constant. In that case, all bets on the future
are off. The universe could accelerate and then decelerate,
or vice versa as the dark energy fields rose or fell. A third possibility is that dark energy does not exist at
all, in which case not just the future, but the whole
carefully constructed jigsaw puzzle of cosmology, might be
in doubt. The effects of cosmic acceleration could be
mimicked, astronomers say, by unusual dust in the far
universe or by unsuspected changes in the characteristics
of supernovas over cosmic time. As a result, more groups
are joining the original two teams in the hunt for new
supernovas and other ways to measure the effects of dark
energy on the history of the universe. Dr. Perlmutter has proposed building a special satellite
telescope, the Supernova Astronomy Project, to investigate
exactly when and how abruptly the cosmic acceleration
kicked in. The Nagging QuestionsA Grand Synthesis, 
But Hardly Complete 
For all the new answers being
harvested, some old questions linger, and they have now
been joined by new ones. A flat universe is the most mathematically appealing
solution of Einstein's equations, cosmologists agree. But
they are puzzled by the specific recipe, large helpings of
dark matter and dark energy, that nature has chosen. Dr.
Turner called it ""a preposterous universe."" But Dr. Martin Rees, a Cambridge University cosmologist,
said that the discovery of a deeper principle governing the
universe and, perhaps, life, may alter our view of what is
fundamental. Some features of the universe that are now
considered fundamental - like the exact mixture of dark
matter, dark energy and regular stuff in the cosmos - may
turn out to be mere accidents of evolution in one out of
the many, many universes allowed by eternal inflation. ""If we had a theory, then we would know whether there were
many big bangs or one,"" Dr. Rees said. The answers to these
and other questions, many scientists suspect, have to await
the final unification of physics, a theory that reconciles
Einstein's relativity, which describes the shape of the
universe, to the quantum chaos that lives inside it. Such a theory, quantum gravity, is needed to describe the
first few moments of the universe, when it was so small
that even space and time should become fuzzy and
discontinuous. For two decades, many physicists have placed their bets for
quantum gravity on string theory, which posits that
elementary particles are tiny strings vibrating in a 10- or
11-dimensional space. Each kind of particle, in a sense,
corresponds to a different note on the string. In principle, string theory can explain all the forces of
nature. But even its adherents concede that their equations
are just approximations to an unknown theory that they call
M-theory, with ""M"" standing for matrix, magic, mystery or
even mother, as in ""mother of all theories."" Moreover, the
effects of ""stringy physics"" are only evident at energies
forever beyond the limits of particle accelerators. Some string theorists have ventured into cosmology, hoping,
to discover some effect that would show up in the poor
man's particle accelerator, the sky. In addition to strings, the theory also includes membranes,
or ""branes,"" of various dimensions. Our universe can be
envisioned as such a brane floating in higher-dimensional
space like a leaf in a fish tank, perhaps with other brane
universes nearby. These branes could interact
gravitationally or even collide, setting off the Big Bang. In one version suggested last year by four cosmologists
led by Dr. Steinhardt of Princeton, another brane would
repeatedly collide with our own. They pass back and forth
through each other, causing our universe to undergo an
eternal chain of big bangs. Such notions are probably the future for those who are paid
to wonder about the universe. And the fruits of this work could yet cause cosmologists to
reconsider their new consensus, warned Dr. Peebles of
Princeton, who has often acted as the conscience of the
cosmological community, trying to put the brakes on faddish
trends. He wonders whether the situation today can be compared to
another historical era, around 1900, when many people
thought that physics was essentially finished and when the
English physicist Lord Kelvin said that just a couple of
""clouds"" remained to be dealt with. ""A few annoying tidbits, which turned out to be relativity
and quantum theory,"" the twin revolutions of 20th-century
science, Dr. Peebles said. Likewise, there are a few clouds today like what he called
""the dark sector,"" which could have more complicated
physics than cosmologists think. ""I'm not convinced these clouds herald revolutions as deep
as relativity and quantum mechanics,"" Dr. Peebles said.
""I'm not arguing that they won't."" As for the fate of the universe, we will never have a firm
answer, said Dr. Sandage, who was Hubble's protï¿½gï¿½ and has
seen it all. ""It's like asking, `Does God exist?' "" he said.
Predicting the future, he pointed out, requires faith that
simple mathematical models really work to describe the
universe. ""I don't think we really know how things work,"" he said.
Although Dr. Sandage does not buy into all aspects of the
emerging orthodoxy, he said it was a fantastic time to be
alive. ""It's all working toward a much grander synthesis than we
could have imagined 100 years ago,"" he said. ""I think this
is the most exciting life I could have had.""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/23/science/space/23UNIV.html?ex=1028416223&ei=1&en=ff38ea5fac0c9158HOW TO ADVERTISE

This seems to be a problem in tk8.4.
There is a switch statement at lines 691-697 in ispell.tcl inside a catch.
It ends with a line ending with a backslash, followed by a blank line.This seems to be enough to confuse this verson of tk.  Removing the backslash
causes the error to go away, and the catch is not executed.

web to speak of, but you'd think a 400km gash in the Earth would be
pretty easy to find ;) I remember it from an issue perhaps in the very
late 80's or early 90's.It's interesting to note that NT7 and many other NEO bodies are all on
trajectories that approach the Earth from under the ecliptic, so with
the Earth tilt, South America becomes a pretty good target.  In trying
to find you a site through Google, I turned up several different
impact sites in Venezuela and Brazil, with ages ranging from 251M to
70 years, but not the 400km gash from the above story.  The only google refs I found from that period is one in Arizona
(famous impact crater) and another in NM; do wish I had noted the
actual South American /country/ that contains the scar; Venezuela
sticks in my mind but I can't be certain.  http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/images/meteorcrater.html--

systems you just add a flag and memory is tracked (that's how i've always
done it) or worst case yuo have to run it through one of the 2.3E7 tools

Just an area of the beach by the prom where he's allowed to make his
sculptures.
Weymouth is where I spent my teenage years. My mum and one sister still live
there.
So I'm pretty familiar with the sculptures; pretty impressive, and very big.
(I think he uses some sort of armature for some bits - it's not just sand)
They usually get vandalised, though; after a lot of drinks, it obviously is
a good idea to break into the enclosure and kick all the sculptures to bits.
Then again, Weymouth is pretty run down, and attracts holiday makers of the
worst sort.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

  |[ ... ]
  |  the issue here is tar(1) (and cpio(1)) archives always
  |  contain the data for each name of a hard link.  [ ... ] ARRGGGHHHH!!!!!
 profuse apologies, the wrong version of my reply was posted
 (blame it on being late for the pub).  ;-( the above is almost pure B*S* --- I got my `tar's and `cpio's
 confused.  what I said _is_ correct, but for cpio(1) archives;
 tar(1) archives do _not_ replicate the data for hard links. I spotted this confusion on my part before I posted my reply,
 and re-wrote it to be more correct, yet somehow the wrong
 version got sent anyways.  ARRGGGHHHH!!!!!  ;-(  ;-(  ;-( anyways, GNU `cpio -p' does not do spurious reads or writes.
 GNU `tar cf - ... | tar xf - ...' also does not, albeit each
 `tar' both reads and writes the data.  hence, there is twice
 (not thrice!) the I/O of `cpio -p', maybe an issue for c.60Gb. using strace(1), I've verified my claim GNU `cpio -p' does
 not do spurious reads or writes, i.e. it link(2)s.  but having
 just come back from the pub, perhaps this should also be taken
 with extra skepticism ......   ;-\ sorry.  cheers!

BUY PRODUCTS70 to 80%
BELOW WHOLESALENEW, AND IN QUANTITIES YOU NEED
A SINGLE UNIT, A PALLET,
  OR A TRUCKLOAD1. Do you consider yourself ""FINANCIALLY SECURE""?
2. Are you still looking for a very Real Business that can provide you and
  your family with the lifestyle you desire and deserve? Or,just a second
  income in your spare time?3. Would you invest $66.50 (A 25% discount off of our regular price of
  $99.95 during this limited time promotion. ) in a business that could make you
  ""FINANCIALLY SECURE""?
If so, read on:
This is not a get rich quick scheme, but, it is a way for you to get into
  a business with a minimal investment and, may be your first step towards a
  rewarding first, or second income. For the longest time, only those, who were
  able to make large investments were able to take advantage of this type of a
  business. We have made it possible for everyone to do it, and at a price
  everyone can afford.Â Corporate America has conditioned us to believe that security comes from
  employment. Yet layoffs are hitting an all time high, major corporations are
  failing and we hope to never become the victims of this downsizing, career
  burn out, illness or injury.
There was a time, when finding another job was not a problem, but today,
  the frightening reality for a lot of people is that ""the
  plastic in their wallets determines the quality of their lives.""
The hard facts show that our economy has moved from the industrial age
  into the INFORMATION, SERVICE AND RETAIL AGE. No longer can you depend on the
  corporation to provide your family with the security you seek.
If you are TIRED OF LIVING FROM PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK, and are willing to
  work a few hours per week, than this may be for you.
Please read further:
We will show you how you can buy, new, not out of date, products for PENNIES
  on the WHOLESALE DOLLAR. We will not just send a
  list, or catalog of where you can buy, but actual point and click DATABASE

  addresses, phone and fax numbers, and their current HOT
  listings. Unlike othersÃ¿FFFF92 distribution businesses where you are provided with
  WHOLESALE CATALOGS, out of date CD's, or lists of Government Auctions that
  sell Jeeps for $10, (which are a myth), we provide an unlimited virtual
  database of items at up to 95% below wholesale from liquidators, not
  wholesalers, that is up-dated on a weekly/daily basis by the suppliers. And
  the products are available for immediate purchase and shipping to you.
This database is designed for the individual or a small business. Although
  there are suppliers in this database selling in large quantities, most are
  selected for their flexability in being willing sell in small quantities at
  great savings (80 to 95% Below Wholesale)
You will be able to buy such items as RCA Stereos that retail for $250.00+
  for $20.00, New Boom Boxes for $12.50 each, Palm Pilots for $39.00, Cell Phone
  Antenna Boosters that sell on TV for $19.95- - for .16 cents, Perfect Pancake
  makers as seen on TV for $19.95, for$6.50, Disney Kids' clothes at $1.85/unit,

  product.

  their websites, fax and phone numbers and a description of what type of
  product they handle and current product specials.And, ""On-going telephone support during normal business hours.""Â Since this is such a fast changing business, with new products being added
  and deleted on a weekly or even a daily basis, all data will be provided
  within 24 hours of receipt of payment via email file transfer. ( no waiting or
  shipping and handling costs) The $66.50 is your total
  one time cost.
This DATABASE is for individuals who recognize an opportunity to make a
  substantial income. Keep in mind, everyone likes a bargain, and even more so
  when the economy is down. So, even if you just want to buy for your own use, a
  single purchase could repay your initial investment. And, remember we provide
  a 30day, full refund satisfaction guarantee.
We know that this has been a brief description, and you may want
  additional information. You may email us at adddata7080@excite.com
  for additional information and a sample of listings currently being offered by
  various suppliers. (If you give us some idea of what
  types of products interest you, we will try to include some sample listings of
  those products.)We look forward to being of service in your new venture.

Dear Friend,
                
We are desparately looking for 100 lazy people
who wish to make lots of money without working.We are not looking for people who are self-motivated.

quick' scheme offered on the internet.
We are not looking for class presidents, beautiful
people, career builders or even college graduates.
We don't even want union workers or trade school graduates.We want the laziest people that exist - the guys and
gals who expect to make money without lifting a finger.
We want the people who stay in bed until noon.

lay on the couch is an effort that is best not thought about.If you meet this criteria, go to this site and join free:http://www.roibot.com/w.cgi?R64190_funprogramIn case you haven't figured it out yet, we want
the kind of people who DO NOT take risks.

something that's NOT a 'sure thing', then do NOT respond.

14000,"Dear friend,I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation
till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over
(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State
Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim
of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and
stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of
confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and
confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where
the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.Yours sincerely,Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko.--

"" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20 to = 90 days was done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report = # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , "" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more = programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , = relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . "" well , i had 196 orders for = report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march = 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in = every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . = 20 always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i ' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! "" threw it away "" "" i had received this program before . i threw it away , but later wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get a copy , so i had to wait until i was emailed another copy of the program . eleven months passed , then it came . i didn ' t throw this one away . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try . "" dawn w . , evansville , in "" no free lunch "" "" my late father always told me , ' remember , alan , there is no free lunch in life . you get out of life what you put into it . ' through trial and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start , i finally figured it out . the program works very well , i just had to find the right target group of people to email it to . so far this year , i have made over $ 63 , 000 using this program . i know my dad would have been very proud of me . "" alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . = 20 any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to = will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for = a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do = that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is = practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free !

this is really a two fold question . let 's talk about the selling of report # 5599 first . all you have to do is place an ad , mail the postcards or send bulk email . if you place an ad send the respondent this sales letter and let this sales letter do the rest for you - no need to talk to anyone ! ! if you mail the postcards or use bulk emailing your job is done ! the postcard will ask the respondent to send $ 50 . 00 to your mailing address . email will work for you if you send it to as many people as you can . if you decide to become an offshore broker and qualify to receive over-rides and commission on the offshore business support services the parent company will do the selling for you if you wish . this is a "" no brainer "" and can be as simple or as complicated as you want to make it . . . talk to the people if you wish or do n't - report # 5599 sells itself ! q . how many hours a week will i have to devote to my business ? a . one to sixty hours a week ! here 's a question i will answer with a question . . . how much money do you want to make ? common sense says the more ads you run and the more mailings you do the more money you will make ! the statistics show that for every 100 responses you receive from your ads , and you mail this sales letter , you will sell five to ten reports making you $ 250 . 00 to $ 500 . 00 ( us ) . your ad responses will vary depending on the place you advertise and the circulation of the publication . the more ads you run or the more emails you send out the more time you will need to devote to your home based business . q . just how much money will i need to start my home based business ? a . $ 50 . 00 ! yeah i know - you ' re thinking you will need money for ads and mailing . well - i ' ve had people start with $ 50 . 00 ( u . s ) and make ten copies of the report and sold them to their associates and friends giving them $ 500 . 00 ( us ) . that gave them enough money to start running ads and to buy stamps . in looking at all the money making opportunities offered in the world today i really do n't think you can get started for any less than $ 50 . 00 and have a better legitimate money-making opportunity than the one offered in report # 5599 ! q . if i have additional questions who will answer them for me ? a . i will or the parent company will ! no package of information , no matter how complete , can possibly answer every question that may come up . i do not want you to lose money seeking out the answers . i want you to succeed ! you will receive a phone number in report # 5599 where you can either reach me or someone from the parent company for any question or help you need ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ here 's a valuable bonus for ordering within 5 days . . . . your 's absolutely free !

Am I correct, I hope?Actually, I am not quite sure... Did I or Natasha Fedorova write 
you before to your other address? Anyway, now I am here instead of 
her too.So, my name is Oksana Svetlova, I live in St. Petersburg, Russia.I have an idea, how we could cooperate to mutual benefit, see, 
possibly you will find it interesting.People are seeking to cut costs with this economy slow-down, right?The thing is that I could get you in touch with developers from
Russia, who will be happy to do a web designer's work for you for
considerably less, than you possibly take from your clients (or 
pay for web-design?), and with _professional_ quality. Also - all
programming, Internet-programming, graphic, flash design, content
writing, translations, etc. If you do web-design, then you may
accept more orders at once, getting a good share from each, and
devote yourself only to that work, you find most interesting.
Alternatively, you can realize more your ideas to develop, more
features to add to your existing sites, and with low costs: from
$12, and an average of $18 an hour.I have put links to their works at www.antee.com/samples_and_faq.htmlAs for reliability, I just saw, how carefully they hand-picked their
specialists, and under what tight management they do their projects.
So, from past experience, it was almost always possible to meet 
deadlines. Also, communication is properly thought-out: a consultant 
is online in ICQ and other instant messengers almost each day, also 
their company has local consultants in many states throughout the 
USA, in Europe and Australia.So, what do you think? A possibility for cooperation?Thank you very much,
Oksana Svetlova.

know a bit of details, they will return you a cost/time estimation.

10715,"It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** Anyone can do it.** It only takes a few hours to learn.When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.
*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.
*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 
*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.
*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 
*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 
*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.
*** Make money on the biggest news stories.
*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 
*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.
*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 
It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.Order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now for only $49.97

Â "" Qualify for at least $25,000 in free
grants money - Guaranteed! ""Each day over One Million Dollars in Free
Government
GrantsÂ  is given away to people just like you for a wide
variety of Business And Personal Needs
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Dear Grant Seeker,
In a moment, I'll tell you
exactly HOW & WHERE to get Grants. This MONEY has to
be given away, WHY not to YOU?
You may be thinking, ""How
can I get some of this Free Grants Money""
Maybe you think it's impossible
to get free money?
Let me tell you it's not
impossible! It's a fact, ordinary people and businesses all across the
United States are receiving millions of dollars from these Government and
Private Foundation's everyday.
Who Can Apply?
ANYONE can apply
for a Grant from 18 years old and up!
Grants from $500.00 to $50,000.00
are possible! GRANTS don't have to be paid back,
EVER! Claim
your slice of the FREE American Pie.
This money is not a loan,
Trying to get money through a conventional bank can be very time consuming
and requires a lot of paperwork, only to find out that you've been denied.
These Government Agencies don't have to operate under the same stringent
requirements that banks do.
You decide how much money
you need, as long as it's a lawful amount and meets with the Government
Agencies criteria, the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid.
This money is non taxable & interest free.
None of these programs require
a credit check, collateral, security deposits or co-signers, you can apply
even if you have a bankruptcy or bad credit, it doesn't matter, you as
a tax payer and U.S. citizen are entitled to this money.
There are currently over
1,400 Federal Programs, 24,000 State Programs, 30,000 Private Foundations
and 20,000 Scholarship Programs available.
This year over $30 Billion
Dollars In Free personal and business Government Grants Money will be given
away by Government Grants Agencies.
Â Government Personal
and Business Grants Facts:
Over 20 Million People Get Government
Money Every Year:
1,000,000 entrepreneurs get money
to start or expand a business
4,000,000 people get money to invest
in real estate
6,000,000 people get money to go
to college
10,000,000 people get free help and
training for a better job
Getting Business
Grants
Anyone thinking about going
into business for themselves, or wanting to expand an existing business
should rush for the world's largest ""one-stop-money-shop"" where FREE business
grants to start or expand a business is being held for you by the Federal
Government.
It
sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the United
States of America wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source
of free business help delivers:
Over $30 billion dollars in free
business grants and low-interest loans;
over one-half trillion dollars in
procurement contracts; and
over $32 billion dollars in FREE
consulting and research grants.
With an economy that remains
unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!
In
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
Most
people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.The fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive FREE GRANTS MONEY and other benefits from the government, and you
should also.Government Grants

GOOD FOR ALL SKIN DISORDERS All Natural Salve, Made by Cold Infusion Ingredients: Chickweed, Comfrey, Mint, Olive Oil, Beeswax, Lavender, 
Rosemary and Eucalyptus. Testimonial: I had a 
skin cancer on my right leg about the size of a dime. It had grown very fast and 
was infected. With daily use of Chickweed Healing Salve the whole 
thing disappeared with 2 weeks without leaving a scar. - Sheila Holbrook,  
 Testimonial: My newly born baby, now one month 
old, had chronic diaper rash. Several doctors had tried to get it to go 
away...nothing seemed to work, she continued to be raw and sore. She cried all 
the time. I tried your Chickweed Healing Salve, putting it on that night. 
By the next morning she was much better. After using it for 2 days, she was 
completely cured. She is now a beautiful baby. She doesn't cry anymore. I paid 
$19.95 for it, however I would gladly have paid $100. Thanks so much. I will 
always keep it on hand. I will gladly give your product a good reference if 
anyone wants to give me a call. Shellie Cooper Stanly, KS 
Testimonial: I had these dark spots on my leg for 15 years. I'm 
not sure what it was but it was growing! After two months of using the 
Chickweed Healing Salve the spots are almost gone. I also use it 
for dry skin on my heels and toes. Its amazing stuff! Kirk B. Testimonial: I 
had a rash under my arm for 9 months. I tried a lot of salves and lotions but 
nothing worked until I tried Chickweed Healing Salve . I applied 
it 2 times a day and it went away within one month. I also had some spots on my 
face. Within 3 and 1/2 weeks they were all gone. Steve Burington 
 Testimonial:I 
burned myself real bad across the chest, arms, and hands. I started using 
Chickweed Healing Salve on my 3rd day in the burn unit at University of 
Louisville Hospital and had immediate results. The nurses were impressed at the 
results, 8 days later I was released. - Charles Mulligan, Athens, 
TNTestimonial:Does a lot of good for just about anything you 
use it for. - William Byler, Centerville, PA  If you

                  URGENT AND NOBLE PROPOSALATTN: DIRECTOR.
DEAR ,I wish to extend my greeting to you and your entire
family. I got your contact from the ivoirian chamber
of commerce, I prayed over it and selected your name
among other names because of its esteeming
nature.Morever,after my strong prayers and fasting,
God reveals to me that you are straight forward,
Honest and GodÂ’s person.
This is the reason I never waste time to propose you
this business for our mutual benefits. Infact, You
will never regret it provided you give me your
possible best cooperate hand, Believe me.I am MARTIN FRANCIS, A cote dÂ’ivoire national and the
only child of late Mr and Mrs FRANCIS. My late father
was the former financial controller of CÃ´te dÂ’Ivoire
telecommunication (CITELCOM). My father died due to
the heat of political crisis in my country recently
last years.But,I am motherless since,before my fathers
late and the death of my mother on 26 SEPTEMBER 1993
was as a result of spiritual attack by our family
member who hated her just because of my fathers
wealth.
Moreover, they tried their own part as well against my
father and myself but negative because God almighty
is available at our side. Infact God is wonderful.
Although, before the death of my father in one of the
private hospital here, he secretly revealed to me
specifically on family matters and mostly the safety
of his monies us$16,500,000.00 (sixteen million,five 
hundred thousand united states dollars) which he
deposited in a bank here in my county Abidjan, 
CÃ´te dÂ’Ivoire and used my name,MARTIN FRANCIS as the
next of kin for the deposits. This amount was accrued
from an over-invoiced contract award for the
construction of an underground telephone network to
replace the former in the new city (Yamoussoukro) and
other major cities also for installation of the
microwave station awarded to my late father,Mr JOSEPH
FRANCIS in 1999 to expatiate companies. In fact, after
the finished payment of  contract workers, my late
father deposited this fund in a bank as the full
beneficiary contractor of the said company (CITELCOM)
this is the fund I want to transferred to your account
as the beneficiary contractor due for payment,providedyou cooperate.Therefore I am seeking your full and
urgent  assistance for the telegraphic transfer of
this sixteen million and five hundred thousand united
states dollars, us$16,500.000 US dollars to your
designated account for a very good business investment
in your country as due to the instruction my father
gave to me before he late. What I require from you are
as follows.1.Your private telephone and fax number for easy and
strict communication
2.Your bank particular for smooth and successful
remittance of this monies to your nominated account
3.You have to make necessary arrangement for me to
meet with you immediately the monies is been
transferred in your account and confirmed by you.
4.You have to secure a college for me in your country
to further my education. 
5.You will have to be my guardian and part of the
joint venture investment when I get to your country.Furthermore, my late father had instructed me to offer
20 % of the total sum to the person who is to assist
me out for the transferring of this fund.Moreover, I wish to assure you that this transaction
would be concluded within the next(3)days you signify
interest to assist me out.I suggest that this
transaction should be handled in strict confidence
because I have work out fine every modalities
concerning the transfer of this fund. 
Please and please, kindly hasten up the arrangement as
quickly as possible because my late father instructed
me not to invest this monies in this country CÃ´te-
dÂ’Ivoire. That I should invest abroad of my choice for
the benefit of myself and for security reasons.Thank very much in anticipation of your
acknowledgement of this business proposal and do not
hesitate to contact me immediately you receive this
message with this my direct telephone number mentioned
above, tel : + 225 05775748 for us to proceed

InDigiNet Identifies 
Acquisition Targets with Combined Revenues of $35 Million...
Â 
Telecom Consolidation Begins to Accelerate The Wall Street Bulletin believes 
that the recent 
investment of capital into Level 3, lead by Warren Buffett, 
is further proof of the continued validity of the telecommunication 
market when looked at from the perspective of the small to mid-sized 
enterprises. After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some 
carriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, 
the future may be dim. But for those survivors of the industry 
that have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems 
mean opportunity. ""Every major industry in the history of 
the United States has experienced a similar transformation, from 
the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the mid-1900s 
to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,"" says Robert 
Saunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market 
research firm. Christopher 
Dean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says ""We are seeing all 
the people that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money 
and for the surviving carriers out there, they can get what used 
to cost a few billion for a few millions."" Read the full 
story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the link at the end 
of this newsletter. 
As we write this report, our New Recommendation 
InDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: 
IGTT) has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since 
late May of 2002. As InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its 
business plan, we believe this company will help lead the way 
up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector. This could be our 
strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our Highest 
Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.
Â 
Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous 
Growth Potential 
We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not 
greater than its competition. A similar telecommunications company, 
Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK), share 
price began to explode in April of this year moving from just 
over $0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America 
Holdings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but 
today has a market cap of $267 million.
IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. 
Using the TALK model for potential growth, IGTT could very well 
be trading in the .60 range in only a few months, with a market 
cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an increase of 1000%. 
So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time is right 
 for investors to get in on the ground floor.
Â 
The InDigNet Strategy
InDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company 
that provides small to mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated 
communication solution. InDigiNet is a prestigious ""Diamond"" 
level partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for Cisco and 
Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and 
wireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the 
Company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the 
capital burden of building a communication network. The Companyâ€™s 
strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single market 
communication companies and attractively priced Internet 
Service Providers (ISPs). The Company recently completed 
its acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect. 
InDigiNet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow 
revenue and enhance profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion 
in commercial telephony, data services and technology spending, 
or 33% of the countryâ€™s total market, and this spending 
is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years.

The IT Market
Based on recent studies, the countryâ€™s 7.4 
million SMEs currently lag significantly in the utilization of 
IT and data 
communications, including Internet access, web services, business 
software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT spending increased to $981 
billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7 percent over 
2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market researcher 
IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights, 
growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for 
the first time. In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 
2002 and 2003, IT spending in the US is expected to increase by 
3 percent this year over 2001 to $436 billion, with further growth 
of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect growth of 4 percent 
in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will experience flat 
growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market will 
return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown 
in China, India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa 
and Poland. Source: IDC
Â 
Particulars
The Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our 
Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth recommendation list for the following 
reasons:
1. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer 
bases of smaller, single-market communication companies and attractively 
priced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell 
its bundled service package to the acquired customer base that 
will form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all 
types of communication services - local, long distance, wireless, 
and data. 2. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front 
Range communities but in particular the education vertical market 
has recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data 
network into the existing campus network. The Company's customers 
include United States Olympic Committee 
(USOC), University of Denver, 
and Colorado State University. 
3. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues 
to acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy 
court and smaller communication providers with valuable customer 
bases. Each of the targeted companies are within the Company's 
footprint and will, subject to purchase completion, increase the 
Company's embedded customer base. 
Â 
Investment Consideration
InDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the 
three months ended March 31, 2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 
in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1 2001. At this current growth 
rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for their first 
year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more 
and more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors 
will turn to small to mid-sized companies with their investment 
dollars.

in energy form where a snapshot of your brain is taken using

be helpful. I am however concerned with the high level of

Lagos, Nigeria.
23rd July 2002
Attention President/C.E.O
                   
Dear Sir,REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.Firstly I must solicit your strictest confidence in this subject. This is by virtue of its nature as 
being utterly confidential and top secret. A member of the Nigeria Export Promotion Council 
(N.E.P.C.) who was part of the federal government delegation to your country during a trade 
exhibition gave your particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential operation with 
you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all the parties and 
hope that you keep it top secret because of the nature of the business.Within the ministry of petroleum resources where I work as a director of engineering and 
projects, and with the co-operation of four other very top officials, we have under our 
control as overdue contract payments, bills totaling Thirty One Million United States Dollars, 
which we want to transfer to a foreign account, with the assistance and co-operation of a 
foreign company to receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign individual 
account to receive the funds.The source of the fund is as follows: during the last military government here in Nigeria 
which lasted bout eleven months, government officials set up companies and awarded 
themselves various contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries.  The 
present civilian government is not aware of the atrocities committed by their predecessors 
and as a result, we have a lot of such over invoiced contract payment s pending which we 
have identified floating at the central bank of Nigeria ready for payment.  However by virtue 
of our position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this money in our names.  I was 
therefore delegated as a matter of urgency by my colleagues to look for an over seas 
partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of  US$31,000,000.00 (THIRTY 
ONE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) hence we are writing you this letter. the present civilian government is determined to pay foreign contractors l debts owed 
so as to maintain an amiable relationship with foreign governments and non-government 
financial agencies.  We have decided to include our bills for approval with the co-operation 
of some officials of the federal ministry of finance (F.M.F) and the central bank of Nigeria 
(C.B.N).  We are seeking your assistance in providing us with a good company account or 
any other offshore bank account into which we can remit this money by acting our main 
partner and trustee or acting as the original contractor.  This we can do by swapping of 
account information and changing of beneficiary and other pertinent information to apply for 
payment.  By this act, we would be using your company information to apply for payment, 
and prepare letters of claim and job description on behalf of your company.  This process 
would be an internal arrangement with the departments concerned.I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist 
us in this transaction, your share as compensation will be us$6.2 million (20%), us$21.7 
million (70%) for us and us$3.1 (10%) for 
taxation and miscellaneous expenses.The business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and 
confidentiality.  Also your area of specialization is not m hindrance to the successful 
execution of this transaction.  I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will 
not disappoint me. I will bring the complete picture of the transaction to your 
knowledge when I have heard from you.Thanks for your co-operation,Yours faithfully,Dr. Kataga BakoriNB: Please respond by sending a facsimile (Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1
