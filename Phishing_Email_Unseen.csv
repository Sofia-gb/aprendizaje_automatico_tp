831,"sum : quantification about four weeks ago , in linguist 8 . 948 , i asked a question on behalf of the basque language academy 's grammar commission about the standard or recommended scope of "" quantifier "" and "" quantification "" as grammatical terms , with special reference to the function of "" so many "" and "" so "" in sentences like : there were so many students that we needed a larger classroom . the students were so intelligent that we needed to get another teacher . i wished to know whether it is considered terminologically appropriate to say that not only "" many "" and "" so many "" but also "" very "" and "" so "" quantify , and thus that the function of all of these ( including what i call degree modifiers ) is quantification . better to contextualize the terminological problem that motivated the question in the first place and to help clarify the following report / discussion , let me suggest , ad hoc , calling the two positions contemplated the "" quantifiers versus degree modifiers "" position and the "" quantifiers subsuming degree modifiers "" position respectively ; or for short , the versus position and the subsuming position . it is also only honest for me to declare at this point that my personal position has always been and continues to be that of the versus view , although i tried to word the original question neutrally . at this point i perhaps ought to note that several respondents seem to prefer to treat "" so many ( students ) "" and "" so ( intelligent ) "" as merely various occurrences of a single item "" so "" rather than treating _ so many _ as an "" item "" to be discussed in its own right . i view this as a manifestation of linguistic anglocentrism : unlike english , in many languages "" so many "" is not expressed by the item equivalent to english "" so "" plus a quantifier equivalent to english "" many "" , and since i was not particularly asking about english in my question , i reject the assumption that the english lexical composition of "" so many "" is of crucial relevance to the issue i raised . thanks to the following who responded to my question : bruce d . despain , patricia galea , e . h . klein - v . d . laaken , jan k . lindstrom , p . l . peterson and marilyn n . silva . a summary of their answers and suggestions follows , with an interjection of my own personal opinion at times , identified by my initials ark . marilyn silva supports the versus position , stating that "" quantifiers determine noun phrases , not adjectives . "" for "" very "" and "" so "" she prefers the term "" intensifier "" to my proposed "" degree modifier "" . patricia galea expresses the same views . ( [ ark : ] since my original question was not about the latter terms , i shall refrain from defending my preference of "" degree modifier "" over "" intensifier "" in this context ; larry trask 's _ dictionary of grammatical terms in linguistics _ treats the two terms as interchangeble . ) marilyn silva also discussed what i called "" consecutive "" sentences , pointing out that the subordinate clauses in the two english examples cited above , "" . . . that we needed a larger classroom "" and "" . . . that we needed to get another teacher "" , are called "" adverbial clauses of extent "" in her treatment of english grammar , _ grammar in many voices _ ( ntc pub . group , 1995 ) . she considers that here "" it is the clause that seems to quantify , not the intensifier in the main clause "" . silva went on to point out that english clauses of extent can be licensed by a main clause containing _ so _ ( with or without _ many _ ) , as above , but also by one containing _ such _ , as in : george was such a gentleman that he never raised his voice . and draws our attention to the fact that _ such _ could hardly be called a quantifier . ( [ ark : ] this argument seems to be of general typological interest , independently of the fact that there is no real equivalent of this use of _ such _ in basque . ) in all these sentences with extent clauses , silva argues , "" it is the [ subordinate ] clause that seems to quantify , not the intensifier in the main clause . . . which merely licenses the subordinate clause . "" according to silva , then , _ so _ and _ such _ should not be lumped together with items like _ many _ or _ very _ in any case , in line with the view that they do not themselves quantify but merely license a subordinate clause which quantifies . looking beyond english , jan lindstrom pointed out that in swedish a single lexical item , _ mycket _ , functions both as a quantifier ( of nouns ) meaning "" much "" and as a degree modifier or intensifier of adjectives meaning "" very "" , providing the following examples : 1 ) da "" r fanns mycket folk . ' there was much people ' 2 ) hon a "" r mycket intelligent . ' she is very intelligent ' lindstrom does not seem to be defending a particular terminological usage in providing this observation , but merely wishes to offer useful information that may be of interest in the discussion . [ ark : ] it seems to me that while the interest of this sort of observation is undeniable , it does not obviate the need for a terminological distinction , nor does it justify the subsumes position , but rather illustrates the need for linguists to employ a clear meta-language to enable us to distinguish between items or uses even where , as here , their formal expressions overlap language-specifically . ( by the way , some other instances of the use of a single form for "" very "" and "" much "" include portuguese _ muito _ , catalan _ molt _ , and italian _ molto _ ; but i can think of many more languages that do not show this kind of overlap or homonymy . ) philip peterson wrote discussing in somewhat more abstract terms the actual semantics of terms like "" many "" and "" more "" , and referred me to his article "" complexly fractionated syllogistic quantifiers "" ( journal of philosophical logic , 1991 , 20 , 287-313 ) . bruce despain 's comments are oriented to language-specific issues of syntactic classification of quantifiers in english that are not likely to be relevant to a description of basque , for which reason i shall not report his suggestions here . henny klein brought to my attention the following bibliographical reference : gary , e .

I see that Robert S. Wojciechowski Jr. posted about this issue on 7/26,
but I don't see any responses. I get that error when calling razor-report
from a sendmail alias, but not from the command line as a different user.
The way I solved it was to run razor-admin -createandrazor-admin -discoverwith a -home argument set to the global /etc/razor directory, which is
explicitly specified in the args to the alias pipe.The manual page, which suggests that /etc/razor/razor-agent.conf will be
loaded first, does not also say that razor-admin will then create a
.razor directory in the user's home directory if it does not exist
(although this /is/ pointed out in the razor-agents(1) page. This may
lead to some minor confusion if the user is trying to set the discovery
and other defaults for a default (e.g., /etc/razor) install. The
workaround is as I say above, namely, explicitly specify the path to
razorhome on the command line, e.g.razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -create
razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -discoverhth,

So I'm pretty familiar with the sculptures; pretty impressive, and very big.

They usually get vandalised, though; after a lot of drinks, it obviously is
a good idea to break into the enclosure and kick all the sculptures to bits.
Then again, Weymouth is pretty run down, and attracts holiday makers of the
worst sort.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

""Yes, and Eliza and I composed a precocious critique of the Constitution
of the United States of America, too. We argued that it was as good a
scheme for misery as any, since its success in keeping the common people
reasonably happy and proud depended on the strength of the people
themselves - and yet it described no practical machinery which would tend
to make the people, as opposed to their elected representatives, strong.
    We said it was possible that the framers of the Constitution were
blind to the beauty of persons who were without great wealth or powerful
friends or public office, but who were nonetheless genuinely strong.
    We thought it was more likely, though, that the framers had not
noticed that it was natural, and therefore almost inevitable, that human
beings in extraordinary and enduring situations should think of themselves
as composing new families. Eliza and I pointed out that this happened no
less in democracies than in tyrannies, since human beings were the same
the wide world over, and civilized only yesterday.
    Elected representatives, hence, could be expected to become members of
the famous and powerful family of elected representatives - which would,
perfectly naturally, make them wary and squeamish and stingy with respect
to all the other sorts of families which, again, perfectly naturally,
subdivided mankind.
    Eliza and I, thinking as halves of a single genius, proposed that the
Constitution be amended so as to guarantee that every citizen, no matter
how humble or crazy or incompetent or deformed, somehow be given
membership in some family as covertly xenophobic and crafty as the one
their public servants formed.

I don't think there is a specific word in English for eye goop. 
However, when I was halfway literate in Tagalog, I learned that there is
a specific word in that language (or was it another dialect?) for it:
muta, pronounced ""MOO-ta"".  Even though my Tagalog has faded greatly, I
automatically use that word for ""eye goop"" when speaking English (how
often does that happen?), mostly because it apparently filled a
linguistic hole in my brain and therefore permanently wedged itself into
my vocabulary.Not that this is important, but I've inadvertently adopted ""muta"" into
my version of the English language as the word for ""eye goop"".  Arguably
better than ""smegma"" anyway.(Definitely Friday...)-James Rogers

6916,"Hi all.
Does anyone know how to set up dual keyboards(one is actually a stand-alone
keypad)?
Both keyboards have PS/2 connections and I want the keypad to be plugged in
as the primary input device.  Then if the other keyboard is plugged in, that
should take over.
Possible?  Any possible hacks?
Thanks!

Irvine CA 92606July 24, 2002
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEGOVERNMENT REGULATION IS KILLING THE STOCK MARKET       IRVINE, CA -- The steep decline in the stock market is being fueled
by investors' realization that increasing government constraints on
corporate America will harm business and the economy--not help them, said
Yaron Brook, executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute.       ""Instead of launching a witch-hunt against CEOs and rushing to give
the government wider powers over business, we should get rid of the complex
and contradictory regulations that encourage bad accounting and prevent
shareholders from acting in their own interest.""       ""The common explanation that 'greed' is to blame makes no sense--the
abuses in companies like Enron and WorldCom were not exercises in
self-interest, but in self-destruction.       ""In an unfettered free market the desire for profit is satisfied by
honest, long-range, rational behavior: by innovating, by hiring the best
employees, by selling quality products and by providing accurate information
to the owners of the corporation--the shareholders. As for short-range
managers, the markets will not tolerate them. As for the real swindlers,
existing laws against force and fraud are sufficient to protect us.""       ""If our politicians are indeed concerned about the stock market,""
said Dr. Brook, ""let them demonstrate it by eliminating, not adding,
regulations and making the market truly free.""###   ###   ###Ayn Rand Institute executive director Dr. Yaron Brook is available for

A lot. It crashed on me many time while working on my projects. Later ""versions"" of ""2.96"" fixed this, but it wa well after 3.0 wa released that it finally seemed reasonably stable -- and at that point, I just wanted to use 3.0, so I did.Julian _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list"

solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with
solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to
other unixen like HPUX and SCO. Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One
of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your
hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,
they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software
problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc. If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There
is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,
though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore. You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,
who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,
that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a
cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.John

15948,"What's wrong with doing business over the Web?  Web forms.  There's
promising replacements forms, but this is the current state of the
industry: o You find something that you want to fill out.  It's a partnership form,
   a signup for a Web seminar, a request for more information, anything.
 o You start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend
   about 10 minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops
   just to get a small piece of information , whitepaper, or a callback
   when halfway through, you start to wonder if it's really worth your
   time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list. 
 o Pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized.
   I was on a site just now that had every single country in the world
   listed; the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you
   to hit submit, but due to the layout, the ""more>"" tag on the second
   row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except
   about two dozen third world countries. 
 o Even worse, ever time you hit submit, all forms based things complain
   about using the universal country phone number format and will cause
   you to re-enter dashes instead of dots.
 o When you get something that's not entered right, you will go back and
   enter it right, but then some other field or most likely pulldown will
   automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to
   go back and resent that freaking thing too.  Finally after all combinations
   of all pulldowns, you may get a successful submit.
 o You wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation.  
 o Sometimes, like today, you won't be able to ever submit anything due
   to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that
   is internally non-conflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their
   forms submission.What's wrong with this picture?  The company is screwing you by wasting
your time enforcing their data collection standards on you.  I'm sure there's
someone in that company that would be willing to accept ""US"", ""U.S"", ""USA""
""United States"", ""U of A"", ""America"", etc. and would know exactly which
freaking country the interested party was from instead of forcing them
to waste even more time playing Web form geography.  I'm starting to see the light of Passport.  You want more information?  Hit
this passport button.  Voila.  IE6 and Netscape 6,7 have pre-forms sutff,
but I always turn it off because you never know when there's that one field

average user who will get screwed on privacy stuff.  So, if crappy forms-based submission is the state of practice for

",0,"What's wrong with doing business over the Web? Web forms. There's promising replacement forms, but this is the current state of the industry: o You find something that you want to fill out. It's a partnership form, a signup for a Web seminar, a request for more information, anything. o You start wasting time typing in all those stupid field and spend about 10 minute going through all their stupid qualification hoop just to get a small piece of information , whitepaper, or a callback when halfway through, you start to wonder if it's really worth your time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list. o Pull down tag are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized. I wa on a site just now that had every single country in the world listed; the selection of your country wa absolutely critical for you to hit submit, but due to the layout, the ""more>"" tag on the second row wa offscreen so it wa impossible to select any country except about two dozen third world countries. o Even worse, ever time you hit submit, all form based thing complain about using the universal country phone number format and will cause you to re-enter dash instead of dots. o When you get something that's not entered right, you will go back and enter it right, but then some other field or most likely pulldown will automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to go back and resent that freaking thing too. Finally after all combination of all pulldowns, you may get a successful submit. o You wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation. o Sometimes, like today, you won't be able to ever submit anything due to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that is internally non-conflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their form submission.What's wrong with this picture? The company is screwing you by wasting your time enforcing their data collection standard on you. I'm sure there's someone in that company that would be willing to accept ""US"", ""U.S"", ""USA"" ""United States"", ""U of A"", ""America"", etc. and would know exactly which freaking country the interested party wa from instead of forcing them to waste even more time playing Web form geography. I'm starting to see the light of Passport. You want more information? Hit this passport button. Voila. IE6 and Netscape 6,7 have pre-forms sutff, but I always turn it off because you never know when there's that one field that you don't want to submit to the person you are submitting to that automatically get sent, i.e. the privacy stuff is well beyond the average user who will get screwed on privacy stuff. So, if crappy forms-based submission is the state of practice for business enablement on the Web, I can't see this whole data submission and hurry up and wait for u to get back to you business process a working all that well.

If u choose Setup NT from the installation CD it will reboot your system

  IWT Bans RIAA From Accessing Its NetworkAugust 19, 2002Information Wave Technologies has announced it will actively deny the
Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) from accessing the
contents of its network. Earlier this year, the RIAA announced its new plan
to access computers without owner's consent for the sake of protecting its
assets. Information Wave believes this policy puts its customers at risk of
unintentional damage, corporate espionage, and invasion of privacy to say
the least.Due to the nature of this matter and RIAA's previous history, we feel the
RIAA will abuse software vulnerabilities in a client's browser after the
browser accesses its site, potentially allowing the RIAA to access and/or
tamper with your data. Starting at midnight on August 19, 2002, Information

904,"My only joke, thanks to a professor at the University of Manitoba, circa 
1997. Set in the old west.A cowboy is riding along on his favorite horse when he's suddenly 
surrounded and taken prison by a band of roaming Indians. The indians 
take the cowboy and his horse and tell him the traditional way that the 
tribe deals with their victims:
Each day for the next 3 days, you get a wish. If its in our power to 
grant it to you, we will. After the 3rd wish is done, you die a horrible 
slow death. Time for your first wish.The cowboy thinks a bit, and says ""I want to talk to my horse."" So the 
indians bring the horse over, the cowboy whispers in his ears, and the 
horse runs off. A little while later the horse comes back with a 
beautiful blond naked woman. The cowboy and the woman go in the tent, 
appropriate noises are heard, and then the horse takes the woman away.The next day, time for the wish comes, and the Indians, amazed at 
yesterday's performance, all gather round. The cowboy says ""I want to 
talk to my horse"". So the horse is brought over, the cowboy whispers in 
its ears, and the horse takes off. A little while later the horse comes 
back, with a beautiful brunette, naked, same routine as before, cowboy 
and the women go in the tent, ..., etc.On the third and final day, the indians are totally amazed, and are 
eager to hear what the cowboy's wish will be. So they all gather round, 
and the cowboy again says ""I want to talk to my horse."" The horse is 
brought over, and this time the cowboy grabs the horse by the head, 
stares right at him, and says -- ""Read my lips -- Posse! Posse!""

    president-in-exile Al Gore the legitimate winner of the 2000 election, the 
    results of which were subverted through widespread voting irregularities 
    and intimidation.      [... This will likely require] a prolonged bombing campaign targeting major 
    U.S. cities and military installations, followed by a ground invasion led 
    by European forces. ""Civilian casualties would likely be substantial,"" said 
    a French military analyst. ""But the American people must be liberated from 
    tyranny.""     [...] ""Even before Bush, the American political system was a shambles,"" 
    said Prof. Salvatore Deluna of the University of Madrid. ""Their 
    single-party plutocracy will have to be reshaped into true 
    parliamentary-style democracy. Moreover, the economy will have to be 
    retooled from its current military dictatorship model--in which a third of 
    the federal budget goes to arms, and taxes are paid almost exclusively by 
    the working class--to one in which basic human needs such as education and 
    poverty are addressed. Their infrastructure is a mess; they don't even have 
    a national passenger train system. Fixing a failed state of this size will 
    require many years.""    Welcome news. The only way to crush America's fundamentalist tendencies is by

""Exmh""
    (""after"" script)which is probably related to my not having an ""unseen"" sequence anywhere
(certainly not in inbox) - I read all of my outstanding mail before I
tried this new exmh ...Second, I've been used to having a key binding which was to Msg_MarkUnseen
which doesn't seem to exist any more, and I'm not sure what I should replace
that with.   There's obviously a way as the ""Sequences"" menu does this.
The ""Mark Unseen"" menu entry in the message ""More"" menu is still wanting
that function as well...  | For those who have other sequences defined, the window will widen to
  | display the other sequences.Any chance of having that lengthen instead?   I like all my exmh stuff
in nice columns (fits the display better).   That is, I use the detached
folder list, one column.   The main exmh window takes up full screen,
top to bottom, but less than half the width, etc...I have space for more sequences, in the ""unseen"" window, as long as they
remain once nice narrow window (best would be if the sequences could be
ordered by some preference, then ones which didn't fit would just fall
off the bottom, and not be shown).I'd also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring,
just one constant colour - I have been running the unseen window with
background black, on a root window that is all black, with no borders or
other decorations, but made ""sticky"" - the appearance is just like the
folders with unseen messages (and their counts) are written into the
root window (because it is sticky, this small display follows me around
and do I can see when new mail needs processing).I also find that I tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur
in one folder (some I had forgotten I ever created).  So in addition to
the ""sequences to always show"" and ""sequences to never show"", a
preference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder
would be useful, and then have the sequences that occor only in the
folder I'm visiting appear in the list when that folder is current.
This is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining
productive (I quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message
in a folder - the name is used only there, and only for one message,
it gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is
packed, sorted, etc).I haven't updated my exmh for some time now, so I'm not sure if this
next one is new, or just new since 2.5, but the Sequences menu (on the
bar with New Flist Search ...) only contains ""unseen"" and ""urgent"".
It would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder
happens to have defined.   A ""New sequence"" entry would also be useful
(to mark the message with a sequence name that didn't previously exist,
which can be done now using ""Search"" and the pick interface, but is
clumsy that way)Actually, you once could, now when I try this, entering a sequence name
in the pick box, and a single message number, or a range N-N in the
list of messages, and no pick attributes at all, I now get ...syntax error in expression ""int(1+1+(1 hit-1)*(3868-1-2)/(4878-1))""

    (command bound to event)It has been ages since I did this last though.   I tried adding a Subject
to pick on (easy as I know what's in the message...) which made no difference.
Looks as if something is now saying ""1 hit"" when before it didn't, or
similar.  | I've also changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the list a 
  | week or so ago.Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?
Just to make it stand out a fraction more than it does (maybe this is
more apparent to me than many, as I use very small fonts everywhere,
the background of the ftoc line isn't very wide).Hope this helps.kre_______________________________________________

A ""New sequence"" entry would also be useful (to mark the message with a sequence name that didn't previously exist, which can be done now using ""Search"" and the pick interface, but is clumsy that way)Actually, you once could, now when I try this, entering a sequence name in the pick box, and a single message number, or a range N-N in the list of messages, and no pick attribute at all, I now get ...syntax error in expression ""int(1+1+(1 hit-1)*(3868-1-2)/(4878-1))"" while executing ""expr int($minlineno+1+($msgid-$minmsgid)*($maxlineno-$minlineno-2)/($maxmsgid-$minmsgid))"" (procedure ""Ftoc_FindMsg"" line 46) invoked from within ""Ftoc_FindMsg $msg"" (procedure ""Ftoc_FindMsgs"" line 5) invoked from within ""Ftoc_FindMsgs $msgids"" (procedure ""Ftoc_PickMsgs"" line 5) invoked from within ""Ftoc_PickMsgs $pick(ids) $pick(addtosel)"" (procedure ""PickInner"" line 13) invoked from within ""PickInner {exec pick +inbox -list} {4852 -sequence mercury}"" (""uplevel"" body line 1) invoked from within ""uplevel #0 $cmd"" (procedure ""busyCursorInner"" line 8) invoked from within ""busyCursorInner $cmd $widgets"" (procedure ""busyCursorHack"" line 32) invoked from within ""busyCursorHack $args"" (""cursor"" arm line 1) invoked from within ""switch $busy(style) { icon {busyIcon $args} cursorAll {busyCursor $args} cursor {busyCursorHack $args} default {eval $args} }"" (procedure ""busy"" line 3) invoked from within ""busy PickInner $cmd $msgs"" (procedure ""Pick_It"" line 51) invoked from within ""Pick_It"" invoked from within "".pick.but.pick invoke"" (""uplevel"" body line 1) invoked from within ""uplevel #0 [list $w invoke]"" (procedure ""tkButtonUp"" line 7) invoked from within ""tkButtonUp .pick.but.pick "" (command bound to event)It ha been age since I did this last though.

Polite and respectful protest is acceptable then. No dumping tea in the 
harbour or anything like that.
I think the primary purpose of loud and rowdy protests is to get on 
television, and that the tactics can be
justified as a reaction to a systematic removal of alternative 
viewpoints from that medium. On the other hand,
it was a priceless TV moment. There was nothing resembling assault, and 
the protestors were not in anybody's face
(at least in my understanding of the vernacular).And no, being rude and disrespectful is not the way to influence 
politicians, but the standard way of using lobbyists and
writing checks is beyond many of us.Owen",0,"Bill Stoddard wrote:>>Chuck Murcko wrote: >> >> >> >>>Heh, ten year ago saying the exact same word wa most definitely not >>>""parroting the party line"". >>> >>>It wa even less so thirty year ago.

10847,"NRI Number OneExpats help Hindi films make dollars and sense even at their own expenseBy JEANNE E. FREDRIKSENThe expatriate in films is nothing new. Casablanca starring Humphrey 
Bogart as the suave, mysterious Rick in Morocco remains the top favorite 
60 years after its release in America. Although expat characters' lives 
are traditionally painted as being extraordinary, the simple fact that 
they live ""elsewhere"" adds a sense of adventure, a dash of romance, and 
a bit of wishful longing. However, expats have never made the kind of 
impact on films that non-resident Indians (NRIs) have with Hindi cinema, 
both at the box office and on the big screen.According to India's 2001 census, the country's population exceeded the 
1 billion persons milestone, and there are approximately 11 million 
Indians living, working, and studying elsewhere around the world. NRIs 
have become a serious market for the Hindi film industry, particularly 
in the U.K., where approximately 3 percent of the population is 
Indian/Pakistani, and in the U.S., where 1.7 million out of 281.5 
million people are Indian. The rupee box office is now augmented quite 
handsomely by the dollar-and-pound box office, much to the delight of 
directors and producers.Among the films reporting a half-to-three-quarters-of-a-million-dollar 
box office in the U.S. or the U.K. are Aa Ab Laut Chalen (1999), Kaho 
Naa Pyaar Hai (2000), Refugee (2000), Lajja (2001), and Asoka (2001). 
The NRI ""million-dollar-box-office club"" boasts such films as Yaadein 
(2001) and Lagaan (2001) in the U.S. Taal (1999), Hum Saath Saath Hain 
(HSSH, 1999), and Mohabbatein (2000) made the mark or better in the U.K. 
Taal and HSSH doubled their U.K. intakes in the U.S. and brought in $2 
million each. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) tallied up $2.6 million in the 
U.K. Most recently, setting a new high-water mark in the overseas box 
office, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (K3G, 2001) grabbed the No. 10 spot its 
first week of release in the U.S. and earned $2.9 million during its 
five-week run. In the U.K., K3G earned nearly $3.6 million over an 18 
week run.Impressive? Yes, considering that promotion of Hindi films outside of 
the Indian community is virtually zero, although that may be on the 
brink of changing slightly. If nothing else, the figures indicate that 
the NRI spends a big chunk of change on the films.During the past decade, the inclusion of NRI characters in both 
commercial and non-commercial films has been on the rise, and in a 
circular logic, it's only natural that they have become a part of these 
films' stories. Each NRI touches someone in India, and these ""global 
Indians,"" as filmmaker Subhash Ghai has called them, cannot be shrugged 
off as a passing phase. Films featuring or ""made for"" NRIs have been 
criticized by some in India, but in reality, many of those films have 
performed extremely well at the Indian box office. Could this speak to 
the lure of adventure and the romance of the NRI?The first Hindi blockbuster to spotlight NRI characters was Dilwale 
Dulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ, 1995), the story of two young people who grew 
up Indian in London. DDLJ introduced us to the mischievous, 
prank-pulling Raj, who in the beginning fails to graduate but succeeds 
in pilfering a case of beer from an Indian-owned convenience store. In 
the end, he steadfastly applies Indian sensibilities in his pursuit of 
the rebellious-but-trapped Simran as her unwanted arranged marriage 
approaches. Very possibly, because of this juxtaposition of traits, 
attitudes, and events, DDLJ enjoys the distinction of being the 
longest-continually-running film in Indian cinema history.Popularity aside, there is the ongoing issue regarding accuracy in the 
characterization of NRIs in films. Often they are drawn as stereotypes, 
which are easy to lean on, requiring neither depth nor dimension. 
Because of this, Hindi filmmakers may be said to straddle the border 
separating East and West, staying securely at home and dipping into 
their highly-fantasized world of the Indian diaspora.In many cases, commercial Hindi films present an overly-devised sense of 
the NRI as being either corruptly-Westernized or as being more homesick 
than a child gone away to camp for the first time. While these concepts 
may carry a certain truth, the corresponding misconceptions come from 
the minds of the at-home Indians, who wag a seemingly-envious finger at 
the NRI's ability to exist in two worlds: one allowing space and upward 
mobility, the other offering traditions and history.Pompous, materialistic, alcohol-drinking, cigarette-smoking, 
drug-taking, affair-having, spoiled brats â€¦The first Hindi film I saw was Subhash Ghai's Pardes (1997). Despite 
encouraging me to see more films, it made me wonder if ""NRI"" actually 
meant ""Not Really Indian."" If the NRI characters weren't silly, whiney 
troublemakers, they were mean and nasty, embracing every possible 
negative human quality in stark contrast to the pristine Kusum Ganga. 
Even the dialogue and song lyrics in the film were designed to instruct 
the viewer that the West is inferior but one can still bring India back 
into one's life. The film is propaganda at its finest and filled with 
relentless reminders of good vs. evil, purity vs. corruption, right vs. 
wrong, traditional vs. modern â€¦ in short India vs. the West.But this is not where the negativity ends.Very often, there is a ""dress code"" for the female characters to help 
the viewer understand her measure of purity or wickedness: the more 
traditionally-dressed, the more Indian the woman. Unsurprisingly, this 
does not seem to carry over to the men's characters.Running alongside this can be the ""training guide"" in which NRIs are 
constantly reeducated that ""This is not India â€¦,"" ""This is not America 
â€¦,"" ""Only in India â€¦,"" ""This is our culture."" The repetition seems less 
designed to be a natural part of life than to foster reinforcement, as 
if NRIs are too ignorant to appreciate it the first time.When Indians achieve success and wealth, have large homes, and own their 
companies in these films, they are industrious, clever, and respected 
businessmen. The NRI equivalent is held up to a double standard and 
considered materialistic. Even the printed synopsis of Taal in the Eros 
Entertainment/B4U DVD booklet refers to the NRI characters' ""world of 
ruthless materialism."" On the other hand, the Mumbai-based, plagiarizing 
Vikrant Kapoor character is likeable enough and presented as an 
opportunist, which seems to be a step up.Italy is an unlikely origin for an NRI and offspring in a Hindi film, 
but Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (2000) filled the bill. For all the film's 
splendor, it was regrettable that the Indo-Italian Sameer was presented 
as a naÃ¯ve, bumbling nerd who had little going for him beyond his 
singing ability.Yaadein gave us a kind and loving, if slightly confused, single parent 
from London raising three daughters who suffer enough issues to put a 
therapist into a tailspin. As if that weren't enough, the film includes 
an American-raised brat who wants nothing to do with parents, settling 
down, or having babiesâ€”hardly the ideal Indian bride-to-be.And what happens when a married NRI couple splits into the ""modern"" vs. 
the ""old-fashioned?"" The wife is tossed out like the garbage and sent 
home to India as punishment for being unreceptive to having affairs 
outside of marriage. Such is the initial setup for Lajja, Rajkumar 
Santoshi's look into the world of Indian women.Show me the way to go home â€¦The other extreme of NRIs in film is the homesick, culture-craving, 
more-patriotic-than-thou Indian. Building their own mini-Indias for 
maxi-memories, this NRI portrayal takes a real issue and magnifies it to 
unreal proportions. And no film illustrates that as extravagantly as the 
lush and sumptuous Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham (K3G).Not only did K3G enjoy a healthy run at home, it exploded worldwide onto 
theater screens in Indian communities last December and played to packed 
houses for weeks. And K3G is a film in which everythingâ€”homes, 
transportation, finances, fashion, holidays, events, emotions, and 
tearsâ€”sets a new standard for the term ""larger-than-life.""In K3G, much of the post-interval footage takes place in England. For 
Anjali, life in London simmers with a patriotic zeal and an 
all-consuming homesickness manifested in the meticulous maintenance of 
Indian customs and rituals while she separates herself from her 
surroundings. Her need for India is so overwhelming that she relies on 
the false protection of mocking people and places outside of her own 
family and home.Overkill? Certainly, as writer-director Karan Johar's inflated 
representation of what have become some of the filmi passions of the 
typical NRI. But when it boils down to the common denominators without 
the fanfare, flash, and fervor, even those who move across country miss 
their families and familiar surroundings; one always retains a credible 
amount of home-turf loyalty; and if one's heritage is lost, the person 
is rendered as no more than a racial statistic.""Those living in India are surrounded by our culture every minute, even 
if they don't realize it,"" says Vivek Malhotra, a thirty-something NRI 
and business owner in the Chicago area. ""Here it's different, but we 
will always be Indian,"" he continues, striking at the heart of the 
perceived problem. ""Sometimes, I feel that the movies think we've 
forgotten that. Maybe the filmmakers should spend some time finding out 
who we are. I really don't think they have a clue.""On the upside is a beneficial aspect for the children of NRIs. ""It's 
good that these films show our kids what happens in Indiaâ€”the 
traditions, customs, values,"" says Parag Gandhi, a long time theater 
owner and promoter of Hindi films in Chicago. ""They may be modernized in 
India, but the traditional values remain."" And many popular films target 
the late-teens, twenty-something demographic. ""Films such as Dilwale 
Dulhania Le Jayenge, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, and K3G,"" adds Gandhi, ""are 
examples of films that are half traditional, half modern, striking a 
balance between the two for all of the markets.""Another positive consideration is that not all films show NRIs in a 
questionable light. Caricatures of NRIs have been challenged in 
commercial films like Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, Dil Chhata Hai (2001), Monsoon 
Wedding (2001), and the recent Kitne Door Kitne Paas, all of which 
present NRIs as more realistic, more human characters. Aa Ab Laut Chalen 
offers a variety of NRI personalities from the selfish, the conniving, 
and the party animal to the lovable cabbies and the pandit-cop who make 
the best of their situations without complaint. Interestingly, the film 
also dares to include shop owners, Dunkin' Donuts clerks, gas station 
attendants: characters who aren't weighed down by palatial surroundings, 
corporate crises, or overseas judgments.The U.S., the U.K., and Australia are represented in Bombay Boys (1999) 
by three young men coming/returning to Bombay, India for personal 
reasons. In a refreshing reversal of the typical attitude concerning 
NRIs in film, the boys are the ""good"" Indians, and everyone they meet 
has some relationship with the darker side of the city. At its most 
basic, the film shows that if something is lost, it won't necessarily be 
found in India.Even the non-commercial, multi-award-winning Bawandar (2001) 
incorporates an NRI as a connecting thread in the piecing together of 
Sanvri Devi's story. Curious, passionate about women's rights, the 
Indo-English journalist represents the fact that the story has a wider 
interest than a small, rural village.Stepping outside of the Hindi film industry for a moment, the 
English/Telegu film Hyderabad Blues (1998) and the English/Tamil film 
Mitrâ€”My Friend (2002), both smaller-budget films built on delivering 
messages without preaching, deserve mention. The former engages in the 
questioning of, rather than the criticism of, East vs. West, and the 
latter examines the challenges faced by women, NRIs, and their families. 
The characters and stories of both films enjoy respect in their 
presentation, partially due to the existence of layered issues that are 
revealed and resolved (or not) without finger-snapping swiftness or 
clichÃ©d answers. Hyderabad Blues enjoyed a 31-week run in Mumbai alone, 
and Mitrâ€”My Friend is currently one of the most-rented films in Indian 
communities in the U.S.While the inclusion of NRIs in Hindi films does not guarantee box office 
success outside of India, it does send a strong signal that filmmakers 
acknowledge this constantly growing and lucrative audience sector. If 
the big-budget, big box-office commercial films coming out of Mumbai 
often seem to bite one of the hands that feeds it, has the box office 
anywhere been adversely affected? Well â€¦ no, not by any charted reports 
that can be found. And that, itself, sends a loud and clear message back 
to the industry in Mumbai: ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it.""Nevertheless, when filmmakers who see NRIs as falling only to the evil 
side of Western ways look beyond their assumptions, perhaps they will 
discard their reliance on stereotypes and start paying their overseas 
family an increased measure of respect. And when filmmakers who take the 
homesick and patriotic themes beyond believability analyze their own 
feelings, perhaps they will realize that what NRIs hold dear in their 
hearts is no different from what those at home should be proud of. nNOTE: All box office figures are reported as US$ and are courtesy of 
Variety Magazine online archives. Not all Hindi films abroad report box 
office, and not all box office reports are available.Jeanne E. Fredriksen writes from Chicago. She is family with, friends 
with, acquainted with, and works for NRIs with an amazing variety of 
personalities, attitudes, hopes, dreams, goals, livelihoods, needs, 
wants, and beliefs.=========================================

Dilwale Dulhaniya Le JayengeSo globally successful is the film that in 1999 it warranted a billboard 
outside Shinjuku train station in Tokyo, Japan, announcing its 
screenings sponsored by India Center there. Shinjuku is the 
entertainment center of Tokyo, and there is plenty of high-profile 
competition for attention, attendance, and box office. In Japan, where 
Indian films enjoy a certain popularity with the natives, the country's 
1995 population census of 125.6 million persons showed only 4,244 were 
Indian with an additional 13,589 being other South Asians. Without 
question, DDLJ continues to be a favorite whenever, wherever offered for 
viewing.Kabhi Khushi Kabhie GhamAccording to a report in the South China Morning Post in January, 2002, 
all screenings of K3G in December, 2001, were sell-outs in Hong Kong, 
while pirated copies of the film were the hottest items circulating on 
the island. Hong Kong's 2001 population census of 6.3 million people 
revealed that 18,543 were Indian and another 23,581 were Nepalese and 
Pakistani. K3G's popularity in the Special Administrative Region was 
impressive because Hong Kong enjoys being the third-largest producer of 
films by volume after India and the U.S. Â

Bhansali's Musical HeavenBy ANIRUDDH CHAWDADEVDAS (Universal, 2002). Hindi film soundtrack. Music: Ismail Darbar. 
Lyrics: Nusrat BadrFor perhaps the most eagerly anticipated film of the year, filmmaker 
Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas had to deliver a score that not only met 
the hype but also let Ismail Darbar prove that the mega-selling Hum Dil 
De Chuke Sanam was no one-time flash in the pan. By devising a 
semi-classical, once-in-a-decade, 100 percent ""Indian"" musical score, 
Bhansali and Darbar emerge victorious in baking and serving a 10-layer 
monumental soundtrack.What is most groundbreaking is the powerful one-two punch of lyrics by 
newcomer Nusrat Badr and the from-soul-voice of first-timer Shreya 
Ghosal. Ghosal's voice, reminiscent of both Suman Kalyanpur with a 
slightly thicker pitch and Anuradha Paudwal without the nasal monotone, 
is the most original singing voice since Kavita Subramaniam appeared in 
the Mangeshkar mold. Ghosal's ""Silsila ye chaahat ka"" is a sultry 
tabla-dominated opening to 52 minutes of sheer musical bliss. ""Maar 
daala"" (Subramaniam, KK) is an excellent example of the use of classical 
ragas to complement, rather than fill-in, interludes between verses. On 
""Kahe chhed,"" Pandit Birju Maharaj, using his own tune, adds an 
intoxicating opening for Madhuri Dixit's vocals and Subramaniam to 
finish out a piercing song of longing.While a combination of Ghosal and Subramaniam give life to on-screen 
lip-synching for Madhuri Dixit and Aishwarya Rai, on the male side Udit 
Narayan fronts for Shah Rukh Khan. Narayan's on-target ""Bairi piya,"" a 
duet with Ghosal, could find company in many Lata-Rafi duets of yore. 
The up-tempo ""Chalak chalak"" again smoothly floats Narayan with Vinod 
Rathod and Ghosal while Subramaniam and Ghosal's jugalbandhi on ""Dola re 
dola"" simply shakes the rafters.Packaged in Universal's Bombay plant, the earliest CD pressings have a 
cheap, paper-thin casing. Purists may consider replacing the cheap cover 
with a store-bought sturdier one. At a suggested Bombay retail value of 
about $2 and selling like hot cakes stateside for $10 a pop, Devdas is 
without doubt a huge profit-maker for the multinational music marketer. 
But buyers beware: avoid being distracted by bootleg CDs. This 
exceptional music and exceptionally well-recorded CD deserve 
unadulterated musical glory. Pop in only a properly copyrighted, 
original CD and let Darbar & Co. whisk you away on a magical musical 
ride.Lifelong cinephile Aniruddh Chawda lives, works, and writes from 
Wisconsin, on America's north coast.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0,"NRI Number OneExpats help Hindi film make dollar and sense even at their own expenseBy JEANNE E. FREDRIKSENThe expatriate in film is nothing new. Casablanca starring Humphrey Bogart a the suave, mysterious Rick in Morocco remains the top favorite 60 year after it release in America. Although expat characters' life are traditionally painted a being extraordinary, the simple fact that they live ""elsewhere"" add a sense of adventure, a dash of romance, and a bit of wishful longing. However, expat have never made the kind of impact on film that non-resident Indians (NRIs) have with Hindi cinema, both at the box office and on the big screen.According to India's 2001 census, the country's population exceeded the 1 billion person milestone, and there are approximately 11 million Indians living, working, and studying elsewhere around the world. NRIs have become a serious market for the Hindi film industry, particularly in the U.K., where approximately 3 percent of the population is Indian/Pakistani, and in the U.S., where 1.7 million out of 281.5 million people are Indian. The rupee box office is now augmented quite handsomely by the dollar-and-pound box office, much to the delight of director and producers.Among the film reporting a half-to-three-quarters-of-a-million-dollar box office in the U.S. or the U.K. are Aa Ab Laut Chalen (1999), Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai (2000), Refugee (2000), Lajja (2001), and Asoka (2001). The NRI ""million-dollar-box-office club"" boast such film a Yaadein (2001) and Lagaan (2001) in the U.S. Taal (1999), Hum Saath Saath Hain (HSSH, 1999), and Mohabbatein (2000) made the mark or better in the U.K. Taal and HSSH doubled their U.K. intake in the U.S. and brought in $2 million each. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) tallied up $2.6 million in the U.K. Most recently, setting a new high-water mark in the overseas box office, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (K3G, 2001) grabbed the No. 10 spot it first week of release in the U.S. and earned $2.9 million during it five-week run. In the U.K., K3G earned nearly $3.6 million over an 18 week run.Impressive? Yes, considering that promotion of Hindi film outside of the Indian community is virtually zero, although that may be on the brink of changing slightly. If nothing else, the figure indicate that the NRI spends a big chunk of change on the films.During the past decade, the inclusion of NRI character in both commercial and non-commercial film ha been on the rise, and in a circular logic, it's only natural that they have become a part of these films' stories. Each NRI touch someone in India, and these ""global Indians,"" a filmmaker Subhash Ghai ha called them, cannot be shrugged off a a passing phase. Films featuring or ""made for"" NRIs have been criticized by some in India, but in reality, many of those film have performed extremely well at the Indian box office. Could this speak to the lure of adventure and the romance of the NRI?The first Hindi blockbuster to spotlight NRI character wa Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ, 1995), the story of two young people who grew up Indian in London. DDLJ introduced u to the mischievous, prank-pulling Raj, who in the beginning fails to graduate but succeeds in pilfering a case of beer from an Indian-owned convenience store. In the end, he steadfastly applies Indian sensibility in his pursuit of the rebellious-but-trapped Simran a her unwanted arranged marriage approaches. Very possibly, because of this juxtaposition of traits, attitudes, and events, DDLJ enjoys the distinction of being the longest-continually-running film in Indian cinema history.Popularity aside, there is the ongoing issue regarding accuracy in the characterization of NRIs in films. Often they are drawn a stereotypes, which are easy to lean on, requiring neither depth nor dimension. Because of this, Hindi filmmaker may be said to straddle the border separating East and West, staying securely at home and dipping into their highly-fantasized world of the Indian diaspora.In many cases, commercial Hindi film present an overly-devised sense of the NRI a being either corruptly-Westernized or a being more homesick than a child gone away to camp for the first time. While these concept may carry a certain truth, the corresponding misconception come from the mind of the at-home Indians, who wag a seemingly-envious finger at the NRI's ability to exist in two worlds: one allowing space and upward mobility, the other offering tradition and history.Pompous, materialistic, alcohol-drinking, cigarette-smoking, drug-taking, affair-having, spoiled brat â€¦The first Hindi film I saw wa Subhash Ghai's Pardes (1997). Despite encouraging me to see more films, it made me wonder if ""NRI"" actually meant ""Not Really Indian."" If the NRI character weren't silly, whiney troublemakers, they were mean and nasty, embracing every possible negative human quality in stark contrast to the pristine Kusum Ganga. Even the dialogue and song lyric in the film were designed to instruct the viewer that the West is inferior but one can still bring India back into one's life. The film is propaganda at it finest and filled with relentless reminder of good vs. evil, purity vs. corruption, right vs. wrong, traditional vs. modern â€¦ in short India vs. the West.But this is not where the negativity ends.Very often, there is a ""dress code"" for the female character to help the viewer understand her measure of purity or wickedness: the more traditionally-dressed, the more Indian the woman. Unsurprisingly, this doe not seem to carry over to the men's characters.Running alongside this can be the ""training guide"" in which NRIs are constantly reeducated that ""This is not India â€¦,"" ""This is not America â€¦,"" ""Only in India â€¦,"" ""This is our culture."" The repetition seems less designed to be a natural part of life than to foster reinforcement, a if NRIs are too ignorant to appreciate it the first time.When Indians achieve success and wealth, have large homes, and own their company in these films, they are industrious, clever, and respected businessmen. The NRI equivalent is held up to a double standard and considered materialistic. Even the printed synopsis of Taal in the Eros Entertainment/B4U DVD booklet refers to the NRI characters' ""world of ruthless materialism."" On the other hand, the Mumbai-based, plagiarizing Vikrant Kapoor character is likeable enough and presented a an opportunist, which seems to be a step up.Italy is an unlikely origin for an NRI and offspring in a Hindi film, but Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (2000) filled the bill. For all the film's splendor, it wa regrettable that the Indo-Italian Sameer wa presented a a naÃ¯ve, bumbling nerd who had little going for him beyond his singing ability.Yaadein gave u a kind and loving, if slightly confused, single parent from London raising three daughter who suffer enough issue to put a therapist into a tailspin. As if that weren't enough, the film includes an American-raised brat who want nothing to do with parents, settling down, or having babiesâ€”hardly the ideal Indian bride-to-be.And what happens when a married NRI couple split into the ""modern"" vs. the ""old-fashioned?"" The wife is tossed out like the garbage and sent home to India a punishment for being unreceptive to having affair outside of marriage. Such is the initial setup for Lajja, Rajkumar Santoshi's look into the world of Indian women.Show me the way to go home â€¦The other extreme of NRIs in film is the homesick, culture-craving, more-patriotic-than-thou Indian. Building their own mini-Indias for maxi-memories, this NRI portrayal take a real issue and magnifies it to unreal proportions. And no film illustrates that a extravagantly a the lush and sumptuous Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham (K3G).Not only did K3G enjoy a healthy run at home, it exploded worldwide onto theater screen in Indian community last December and played to packed house for weeks. And K3G is a film in which everythingâ€”homes, transportation, finances, fashion, holidays, events, emotions, and tearsâ€”sets a new standard for the term ""larger-than-life.""In K3G, much of the post-interval footage take place in England. For Anjali, life in London simmer with a patriotic zeal and an all-consuming homesickness manifested in the meticulous maintenance of Indian custom and ritual while she separate herself from her surroundings. Her need for India is so overwhelming that she relies on the false protection of mocking people and place outside of her own family and home.Overkill? Certainly, a writer-director Karan Johar's inflated representation of what have become some of the filmi passion of the typical NRI. But when it boil down to the common denominator without the fanfare, flash, and fervor, even those who move across country miss their family and familiar surroundings; one always retains a credible amount of home-turf loyalty; and if one's heritage is lost, the person is rendered a no more than a racial statistic.""Those living in India are surrounded by our culture every minute, even if they don't realize it,"" say Vivek Malhotra, a thirty-something NRI and business owner in the Chicago area. ""Here it's different, but we will always be Indian,"" he continues, striking at the heart of the perceived problem. ""Sometimes, I feel that the movie think we've forgotten that. Maybe the filmmaker should spend some time finding out who we are. I really don't think they have a clue.""On the upside is a beneficial aspect for the child of NRIs. ""It's good that these film show our kid what happens in Indiaâ€”the traditions, customs, values,"" say Parag Gandhi, a long time theater owner and promoter of Hindi film in Chicago. ""They may be modernized in India, but the traditional value remain."" And many popular film target the late-teens, twenty-something demographic. ""Films such a Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, and K3G,"" add Gandhi, ""are example of film that are half traditional, half modern, striking a balance between the two for all of the markets.""Another positive consideration is that not all film show NRIs in a questionable light. Caricatures of NRIs have been challenged in commercial film like Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, Dil Chhata Hai (2001), Monsoon Wedding (2001), and the recent Kitne Door Kitne Paas, all of which present NRIs a more realistic, more human characters. Aa Ab Laut Chalen offer a variety of NRI personality from the selfish, the conniving, and the party animal to the lovable cabby and the pandit-cop who make the best of their situation without complaint. Interestingly, the film also dare to include shop owners, Dunkin' Donuts clerks, gas station attendants: character who aren't weighed down by palatial surroundings, corporate crises, or overseas judgments.The U.S., the U.K., and Australia are represented in Bombay Boys (1999) by three young men coming/returning to Bombay, India for personal reasons. In a refreshing reversal of the typical attitude concerning NRIs in film, the boy are the ""good"" Indians, and everyone they meet ha some relationship with the darker side of the city. At it most basic, the film show that if something is lost, it won't necessarily be found in India.Even the non-commercial, multi-award-winning Bawandar (2001) incorporates an NRI a a connecting thread in the piecing together of Sanvri Devi's story. Curious, passionate about women's rights, the Indo-English journalist represents the fact that the story ha a wider interest than a small, rural village.Stepping outside of the Hindi film industry for a moment, the English/Telegu film Hyderabad Blues (1998) and the English/Tamil film Mitrâ€”My Friend (2002), both smaller-budget film built on delivering message without preaching, deserve mention. The former engages in the questioning of, rather than the criticism of, East vs. West, and the latter examines the challenge faced by women, NRIs, and their families. The character and story of both film enjoy respect in their presentation, partially due to the existence of layered issue that are revealed and resolved (or not) without finger-snapping swiftness or clichÃ©d answers. Hyderabad Blues enjoyed a 31-week run in Mumbai alone, and Mitrâ€”My Friend is currently one of the most-rented film in Indian community in the U.S.While the inclusion of NRIs in Hindi film doe not guarantee box office success outside of India, it doe send a strong signal that filmmaker acknowledge this constantly growing and lucrative audience sector. If the big-budget, big box-office commercial film coming out of Mumbai often seem to bite one of the hand that feed it, ha the box office anywhere been adversely affected? Well â€¦ no, not by any charted report that can be found. And that, itself, sends a loud and clear message back to the industry in Mumbai: ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it.""Nevertheless, when filmmaker who see NRIs a falling only to the evil side of Western way look beyond their assumptions, perhaps they will discard their reliance on stereotype and start paying their overseas family an increased measure of respect. And when filmmaker who take the homesick and patriotic theme beyond believability analyze their own feelings, perhaps they will realize that what NRIs hold dear in their heart is no different from what those at home should be proud of. nNOTE: All box office figure are reported a US$ and are courtesy of Variety Magazine online archives. Not all Hindi film abroad report box office, and not all box office report are available.Jeanne E. Fredriksen writes from Chicago. She is family with, friend with, acquainted with, and work for NRIs with an amazing variety of personalities, attitudes, hopes, dreams, goals, livelihoods, needs, wants, and beliefs.========================================= Â Dilwale Dulhaniya Le JayengeSo globally successful is the film that in 1999 it warranted a billboard outside Shinjuku train station in Tokyo, Japan, announcing it screening sponsored by India Center there. Shinjuku is the entertainment center of Tokyo, and there is plenty of high-profile competition for attention, attendance, and box office. In Japan, where Indian film enjoy a certain popularity with the natives, the country's 1995 population census of 125.6 million person showed only 4,244 were Indian with an additional 13,589 being other South Asians. Without question, DDLJ continues to be a favorite whenever, wherever offered for viewing.Kabhi Khushi Kabhie GhamAccording to a report in the South China Morning Post in January, 2002, all screening of K3G in December, 2001, were sell-outs in Hong Kong, while pirated copy of the film were the hottest item circulating on the island. Hong Kong's 2001 population census of 6.3 million people revealed that 18,543 were Indian and another 23,581 were Nepalese and Pakistani. K3G's popularity in the Special Administrative Region wa impressive because Hong Kong enjoys being the third-largest producer of film by volume after India and the U.S. Â ===================================================== Bhansali's Musical HeavenBy ANIRUDDH CHAWDADEVDAS (Universal, 2002). Hindi film soundtrack. Music: Ismail Darbar. Lyrics: Nusrat BadrFor perhaps the most eagerly anticipated film of the year, filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas had to deliver a score that not only met the hype but also let Ismail Darbar prove that the mega-selling Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam wa no one-time flash in the pan.

The clue below are *loaded* with snippet unique to HTML (like '').I *meant* to say that they were 0.99 clue cancelled out by 0.01 clues. But that's wrong too! It look I haven't grokked this part of your code yet; this one ha way more than 16 clues, and it seems the classifier basically ended up counting way more 0.99 than 0.01 clues, and no others made it into the list. I thought it wa looking for clue with value in between; apparently it found none that weren't exactly 0.5?> That sure set the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues!This happened to be the longest one, but there were quite a few similar ones. I wonder if there's anything we can learn from looking at the clue and the HTML.

for security purposes (usually JavaCards) have built-in crypto co-processors 
that make clock rate irrelevant. 4mhz SmartCards can often preform triple-DES 
faster than general purpose processors clocked at ten times the speed.That said, clock rate has nothing with how trustworthy a card is. As Michael 
pointed out, there's something of an arms-race between manufacturers and 
attackers which has nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again 
what we've seen is that it's not a question of ""is it secure"", it's a 
question of ""who is it secure from and for how long?"" Security is rarely a 
question of absolutes (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather 
it's a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk. SmartCards are 
designed to address threats in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the

around attacker and timeframe. One might expect a bored undergrad EE student 
to have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than, 
say, a governtment intelligence service. If your goal is to keep undergrad 
EEs from perpetrating mass fraud in the caffeteria, then a smartcard is 
likely ""trustworthy"" enough for your application. If your aim is to protect 
ICBM launch codes, then it's probably the wrong tool. In either application, 
a risk/cost ratio must justify the use of the protection measure in question.--

Can we consider them a > trusted hardware ?SmartCards do not have fixed clock rate (more often than not) a the ISO spec dictate that they are externally powered and clocked, but SmartCards used for security purpose (usually JavaCards) have built-in crypto co-processors that make clock rate irrelevant. 4mhz SmartCards can often preform triple-DES faster than general purpose processor clocked at ten time the speed.That said, clock rate ha nothing with how trustworthy a card is. As Michael pointed out, there's something of an arms-race between manufacturer and attacker which ha nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again what we've seen is that it's not a question of ""is it secure"", it's a question of ""who is it secure from and for how long?"" Security is rarely a question of absolute (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather it's a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk. SmartCards are designed to address threat in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the $1-20 range (depending on the application).As whether or not they are ""trusted hardware"", the question again revolves around attacker and timeframe.

wish to introduce myself , i am daniel kabila the son of the late drc president laurent desire kabila of the blessed memory . i know this letter might come to you as a surprise but i honestly do not intend to surprise you . i write this letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of us $ 12 m ( twelve million united state dollars ) with you . i inherited this money from my mother . this money was got through the smuggling and sales of diamond and timber when my father was the head of state . my mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position to engage in the business of diamond and timber since she knows that her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the privilege situation . when my father was assassinated on 16 th jan . 01 by one of his bodyguards lt . rashidi kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers that wanted to topple him i escaped to sa because of the fear that i might be arrested by my half brother lt . general joseph kabila the present head of state . actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of relationship because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and this ultimately affected us their children . considering the relationship between sa and my country ' s new government , my mother advised me to leave for sa for security reason , while the funds were deposited with a security company abroad . on getting to there where i have been living since then as a political refugee i am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this money out for safe banking and profitable investment . honestly i contacted you because i don ' t want to invest this money in here due to my status here as a political refugee . and moreover i wouldn ' t want to take risk because this money is all that i and my mother is depending on because my half brother has seized all my father ' s assets and money and left i and my mother empty handed without knowing about this funds deposited at the security company in abroad so that is why i decided that investing this money abroad should be the best investment for me . i will be honored if i can be given the privilege of investing this money with your help . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distress call to save my mother and i from a hopeless future . and if you agree , i hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 15 % of the total money and annual 5 % of the after tax returns on investment for the first three years . thereafter , the term shall be varied . 5 % for expenses , which may arise during the transaction ( fax and phone bills inclusive ) . when the money is moved into your discrete account , you will be allowed to draw 15 % in your favor , while the remaining 80 % will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in your area of business and deterrents sectors of the economy in your country which are dividends

Am I correct, I hope?Actually, I am not quite sure... Did I or Natasha Fedorova write 
you before to your other address? Anyway, now I am here instead of 
her too.So, my name is Oksana Svetlova, I live in St. Petersburg, Russia.I have an idea, how we could cooperate to mutual benefit, see, 
possibly you will find it interesting.People are seeking to cut costs with this economy slow-down, right?The thing is that I could get you in touch with developers from
Russia, who will be happy to do a web designer's work for you for
considerably less, than you possibly take from your clients (or 
pay for web-design?), and with _professional_ quality. Also - all
programming, Internet-programming, graphic, flash design, content
writing, translations, etc. If you do web-design, then you may
accept more orders at once, getting a good share from each, and
devote yourself only to that work, you find most interesting.
Alternatively, you can realize more your ideas to develop, more
features to add to your existing sites, and with low costs: from
$12, and an average of $18 an hour.I have put links to their works at www.antee.com/samples_and_faq.htmlAs for reliability, I just saw, how carefully they hand-picked their
specialists, and under what tight management they do their projects.
So, from past experience, it was almost always possible to meet 
deadlines. Also, communication is properly thought-out: a consultant 
is online in ICQ and other instant messengers almost each day, also 
their company has local consultants in many states throughout the 
USA, in Europe and Australia.So, what do you think? A possibility for cooperation?Thank you very much,
Oksana Svetlova.
oksana@antee.comPS. Just in case you need any type of IT works now, please let me 
know a bit of details, they will return you a cost/time estimation.
